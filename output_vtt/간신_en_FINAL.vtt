00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:33.385
hear my tale. It is the 10th year of his rule. On the night of Blood Moon, two men met the mother of deposed Queen Yoon.

2
00:01:34.178 --> 00:01:42.186
Through them the king obtained

3
00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:49.359
a blood stained woman's clothing. Is this really what my mother was wearing

4
00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:53.447
when she was killed?

5
00:01:53.447 --> 00:02:43.914
Your Highness! The late king wanted to keep this a secret, so I desired to take this to my grave... So why bring it now? An unknown party hired an assassin to steal it! By whom? Half of the court tried to dethrone the late Queen, so we do not know who's behind the plot. Itâ€™s obviously a matter of disloyalty to destroy her majestyâ€™s last remains But we could not ignore where this may lead to. Who'd have thought, a piece of clothing would result in a blood bath. Where did the enraged king first visit? He killed his father's 2 resentful concubines

6
00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:54.633
with his bare hands, and iron mace. Their bodies were torn up and scattered in the mountain.

7
00:02:56.677 --> 00:03:02.683
He also killed his grandmother for slandering his mother,

8
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:57.613
and those who spread defaming rumors, supporters of dethronement, maids who transported the poison, they were all mercilessly killed by poison, decapitation, and dismemberment into pieces. Traitors' tombstones were destroyed, their remains dug up and smashed to smithereens, eventually ending up as dust in the air. Over 200 remains were fed to the pigs. This killing spree became known as the Second Literati Purge.

9
00:03:58.614 --> 00:04:28.685
However, two men never stopped laughing during the purge Minister IM Soong-jae, and his father IM Sa-hong. They were the most treacherous men alive. What goes around comes around, your bone dust may fly in the wind one day...

10
00:04:47.663 --> 00:05:15.649
This brush won't let go once in my hand. Minister! Yes, Highness. I believe all vicious weeds have been uprooted. Your resolve to eliminate them has reached the heavens. It wasn't my resolve alone, your efforts paid off. All done. Come in!

11
00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:57.274
I just love this silver knife. With the will of the taker against the defender of chastity, two innate desires in one... It is simply magnificent. I am honored, Your Highness. I must reward you two for your continuous sacrifices.

12
00:05:58.442 --> 00:06:06.450
Hope you like it. Your grief over the recent affairs

13
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.745
is clearly expressed.

14
00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:18.587
What say you? Vivid sensuality is enough to arouse one's lust,

15
00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:27.137
but their false expression prevent it from reaching grace. Then I must throw this out.

16
00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.723
There is a way to elevate it.

17
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:41.485
IM Soong-jae By claiming it as my own, it'll not taint your reputation,

18
00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:57.417
and it is a masterpiece considering my limited talent. Bullshit! You are something!

19
00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:02.089
Did the king really bestow you this?

20
00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:11.974
Don't you see my name on it? Now, whoever mimics this pose the best, will be awarded with this golden toad.

21
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:23.068
My Lord. We only have one new addition today.

22
00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:30.826
Is she not the one? If you give me that drawing,

23
00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:39.209
What? I heard you check all the new girls.

24
00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:49.011
Who could you be looking for? I'm not sure, but you are definitely not the one.

25
00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:56.602
I heard you're the king's most trusted confidant.

26
00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:15.621
tonight, you are my king. Then I shall show you how a king jests. For every jar I empty, take off an article. If I pass out before you're naked,

27
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.584
in addition to the drawing, I'll bring you into the palace.

28
00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:28.926
But if I win, you'll walk the streets naked. - Will you accept? - Of course.

29
00:09:56.096 --> 00:10:00.058
- My Lord... - Get on with it!

30
00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.066
Please spare me!

31
00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:12.112
Spare you? It was merely a jest!

32
00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:15.073
I overstepped...

33
00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:23.582
You sly devious whore! - Strip all the way! - What's going on?!

34
00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:30.630
Stop this at once! The king's gift is an heirloom! You must be joking.

35
00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:37.721
That lewd drawing as an heirloom? You ungrateful bastard! How dare you!

36
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.851
Don't you know I got you reinstated?

37
00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:47.397
Everyone out! At once!

38
00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:52.945
After these two men shook up the country,

39
00:10:52.945 --> 00:11:16.468
streets were filled with criticisms. The king left official duties behind for carnal desires, royal advices from his ministers fell on deaf ears. He turned a city into a hunting ground...

40
00:11:18.262 --> 00:11:23.267
The hunt for his populace or animals has begun!

41
00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:32.693
As his tyranny peaked, this nation faced a crisis.

42
00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:42.828
'We must call for an uprising, that thrones a fair king to replace the old!'

43
00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:51.211
Today's hunt is starting off with a bang.

44
00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.968
Your life will change if he asks for you.

45
00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:00.720
Giddyup!

46
00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:10.898
It's been a while since us brothers went on a hunt. Indeed, Your Highness.

47
00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:24.953
Have you walked the streets under a disguise lately? Well, yes. If I am preoccupied with official duties, it is your duty to keep an ear on the populace on my behalf. Yes.

48
00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:35.130
Or are you holding something back? What do you mean?

49
00:12:51.897 --> 00:13:02.908
You Highness, how about a friendly race? Yes, that'd be fun! Minister PARK! Yes, Your Highness!

50
00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:07.955
So...

51
00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:10.958
What should we bet?

52
00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:16.922
I have nothing worthy to bet, Your Highness. You have your life.

53
00:13:16.922 --> 00:13:19.633
Highness, you jest.

54
00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:32.938
Don't worry. Many will offer their necks in your stead. How about we test their loyalty to you?

55
00:15:06.323 --> 00:15:11.954
I order you to exterminate storks from our land at once.

56
00:15:13.956 --> 00:15:24.591
Yes, Your Highness! The king began to suffer from apparitions and insomnia,

57
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:38.438
it was said that this was due to heavy blood loss. It was unlike of Soong-jae to miss this chance. Your Highness.

58
00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:46.321
How do you feel? What do you think of the sun?

59
00:15:47.948 --> 00:16:33.994
It is brilliantly radiant, and all encompassing... Just like Your Highness. Then, like the sun, do I... encompass all of Joseon? If you grace women of Joseon with your light, it will rid of their shadows and cure Your Highness. What nonsense, when His Highness is ill. There is no shame in pursuing carnal desires. I'll bring you a millennium of pleasures for one night!

60
00:16:50.594 --> 00:17:11.949
I know my baby's taste the best. I will handpick the girls for my baby's liking, so why don't you allow me... I have plans, so set your worries aside, and help me sleep. What plans?

61
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:19.331
Your Highness, Minister IM has arrived. Let him in!

62
00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:38.350
They say your life flashes before you when facing death.

63
00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:42.354
Do you know what I saw at that moment?

64
00:17:43.647 --> 00:18:01.415
I saw the look of those who wished for my death. I cannot forget the anticipation on their faces. They'll hide their teeth and wait for their time. If their teeth are hidden behind their lips,

65
00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:05.377
why not sew them shut for good?

66
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:13.594
I've been holding banquets despite difficult circumstances,

67
00:18:14.553 --> 00:18:48.795
to seek those who could bear me an heir. I realized I should have searched farther. Ergo, I order a nationwide beauty recruiting. They'll be called 'comforters', and live up to that name. Therefore, Minister IM Soong-jae, and Minister of Defense IM Sa-hong are given full royal authority as 'Beauty Recruit Officers'!

68
00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:54.551
We are eternally grateful, Your Highness.

69
00:18:57.596 --> 00:19:04.269
It's a sunny place and a prime spot to watch the sunset.

70
00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:15.656
I was saving it for a gazebo, but I hope you like it. It's good enough for a palace! Palace? Nice!

71
00:19:19.618 --> 00:19:25.207
How would we solicit to change king's orders? We cannot accept this.

72
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.423
-Sir... - Out of my way! Minister YU...

73
00:19:38.095 --> 00:19:49.648
But you didn't need to be so cold. We cannot ignore her. Thought the candidates were chosen at random?

74
00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:59.950
Those who looked down on us will beg for their lives.

75
00:20:00.951 --> 00:20:31.231
The strong gets to pick, the weak gets picked. One more drink, please? - Come here, bitch! - Minister PARK, it's not our room! I didn't realize the loyal subjects who work tirelessly for the king's virility were here. Excuse me. As if all your scheming and pimping weren't enough,

76
00:20:31.982 --> 00:20:47.873
now you'll scrounge every virgin for his pleasure? Drink quietly. Soong-jae. Are you so desperate for power? Is it today? Your sister's death anniversary.

77
00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:07.976
When the king frequented her room, I was often by his side. What I heard weren't screams, but moans. So why the suicide? IM Soong-jae! How does it feel! To know that you bow down to the man

78
00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:11.230
who raped your sister?

79
00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:16.568
May I have another?

80
00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:50.227
from nobles, farmers, butchers, to even thugs. Any man with balls intact, I can wrap him in my skirt and suck his soul out. How dare you compare the king to peasants!

81
00:21:50.227 --> 00:21:52.229
But isn't the king

82
00:21:52.688 --> 00:22:10.622
also a man? Overconfidence aside, you'll do. Glad that she's to your liking. I cannot tolerate the two 'IM's anymore. I must regain my power, so take special care, Minister YU!

83
00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:18.422
Red!

84
00:22:21.675 --> 00:22:25.762
One word out of the king, the red flag is raised.

85
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:40.694
Show yourself! Show yourself to me! The one who'll comfort the king will become Comforters! The one who'll cleanse him,

86
00:22:41.111 --> 00:23:00.464
will be the Consort! It's not a formal court affair. So it won't be guaranteed whether the king will grace her. But ultimately she'll serve the king. Father!

87
00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:12.684
Let me go! Honey! Daughters, wives, mistresses were all requisitioned...

88
00:23:13.644 --> 00:23:32.496
Wearing red uniform and taking girls away, they were the grim reapers, and not a single woman was spotted on the street. There are more than one way to find girls!

89
00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:47.344
Oh no! Your Majesty! This young lady is destined to become a queen! -  Please stop. - Your Majesty!

90
00:23:49.096 --> 00:23:52.683
Dammit. - Come with us! - Wait! Hold on!

91
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.651
So much chaos and shady deals.

92
00:24:08.156 --> 00:24:23.755
Virgin! Virgins were marked red, while others blue. The royal artist painted day and night, turning teary faces into happy ones.

93
00:24:25.966 --> 00:24:47.112
I think we have enough. But the king will want someone truly unique. They are not enough to win against the Consort. If so... there's one last place to visit.

94
00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:51.700
Enough!

95
00:24:58.665 --> 00:24:59.708
Listen here.

96
00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:28.695
You moved up the deadline, this was all I could muster. So, didn't I say I'll void your debt for a drink with your daughter. Do you not understand?! I'll make her an orphan and take her!

97
00:25:33.325 --> 00:25:37.871
Who's this? You haven't changed at all.

98
00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:43.085
Come in.

99
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:49.633
Come. Father! Father! Are you all right?

100
00:25:54.555 --> 00:25:57.850
I heard you and my father were old friends.

101
00:26:00.102 --> 00:26:35.053
Time travels faster than an arrow. I also heard you promised to achieve greatness together! Did we? Well, it became difficult since my father was dismissed. You could've prevented his dismissal. But instead, you spoke ill of him! Checkmate. Bad move. Mind if I take back?

102
00:26:38.015 --> 00:26:40.017
Not a problem at all.

103
00:26:43.604 --> 00:26:48.442
Look, I couldn't help him back then,

104
00:26:48.442 --> 00:27:09.922
since I was too weak to stand against the court. There was no malice. Please forgive me... Take my fortune! Just look at her, she's my only daughter!

105
00:27:14.927 --> 00:27:21.850
Minister, I have a lover! A palanquin will come for her, so have her ready.

106
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.441
Did you hear? Even Lord JO got raided.

107
00:27:33.904 --> 00:27:45.415
They already took more than ten thousand girls! It's insane! If I ever see one of those scouts, I'll skin them alive!

108
00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:57.886
Why aren't I recruited? I'm the fairest. Shit, your face provokes violence in men. Say what? You asshole!

109
00:27:58.887 --> 00:28:07.020
Leaving already? They'll begin soon. Begin what? Aren't you here for the show?

110
00:28:25.956 --> 00:28:37.926
and the hunger has forced them to eat each other. The enraged mountain god sent a tiger!

111
00:28:39.928 --> 00:29:23.972
With the god's order, it came to renounce the world, but could not find any guilty men. Why should people be guilty of poverty? Corrupt officials behind high walls are the guilty ones. They deserve to die! When the tiger could not climb over the high wall, it decided to become flesh and blood of the peasants, and help wreak havoc on the corrupted. He saw her briefly.

112
00:29:28.936 --> 00:29:36.985
clear peacock eyes, sharp nose, and lips like peach skin...

113
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:45.994
He knew he had found the one! But... she was a meager butcher.

114
00:29:45.994 --> 00:29:48.247
A butcher!

115
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.105
It's no face for a noble. Hey! It's him.

116
00:30:55.981 --> 00:31:08.994
Fitting your title as the women hunter! Going after a girl like a dog in heat! How dare you talk to a noble like that! I got no business with you two, so get lost. Let's go.

117
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:15.751
Who hired you?

118
00:31:16.001 --> 00:31:18.295
Hire me? You got it wrong.

119
00:31:18.295 --> 00:31:22.633
I volunteer myself to kick the shit out of you! - Agree? - Sure.

120
00:32:23.652 --> 00:32:26.989
Why did you follow me?

121
00:32:29.366 --> 00:32:42.212
I once knew a sword dancer. She had a unique hand gesture and steps. Where did you learn that dance?

122
00:32:42.963 --> 00:32:46.800
It came to me while working as a butcher.

123
00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.011
Not from a teacher.

124
00:32:51.263 --> 00:32:52.264
I see.

125
00:32:54.683 --> 00:32:57.978
Sir, I have a favor to ask.

126
00:32:59.062 --> 00:33:01.190
recruit me?

127
00:33:04.985 --> 00:33:09.990
I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Is it because my hands reek of animal blood?

128
00:33:11.408 --> 00:33:18.207
But sir! My father has a large debt. So please... Let go.

129
00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:25.255
I will even... offer myself to you.

130
00:34:00.249 --> 00:34:03.418
I am Jung-hwa, Lord JO's daughter.

131
00:34:57.222 --> 00:35:00.225
Over there! What are you doing?!

132
00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:29.254
Do you wish to die? She's a property of the king.

133
00:35:31.757 --> 00:35:36.428
Your father allowed it... - You lie! - It's true.

134
00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:55.239
Was this your plan all along? She'll be defiled at the palace, it won't make a difference. She's just paying for her father's crimes. Will you give up your power over petty grudge?

135
00:35:56.198 --> 00:36:06.875
Makhana lotus flower blooms once a century. She is the lotus I found! It's too early to know if she'll bloom or wither.

136
00:36:08.919 --> 00:36:15.425
The path towards the king won't be so smooth. I was just startled.

137
00:36:15.425 --> 00:36:20.222
A lowly butcher personating a noble's daughter...

138
00:36:21.723 --> 00:36:29.231
What are you really after? Repaying my father's debt, that's all.

139
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:35.112
You chose to walk this path, let's see how long you last.

140
00:37:28.457 --> 00:37:31.835
We returned from our duties...

141
00:37:34.087 --> 00:37:40.177
Okay! Good! I've waited so long! Good, raise your heads!

142
00:37:41.845 --> 00:37:44.890
You'll eat Joseon's greatest delicacies

143
00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.684
on gold plates to your heart's content.

144
00:37:48.185 --> 00:37:52.356
You'll wear clothes of silk and satin,

145
00:37:52.731 --> 00:38:13.043
we'll hold banquets on the river, bathe in the valley, hunt tigers together, and make love every day... However, if you miss your husband or lover, or even think about escaping, I'll behead you on the spot!

146
00:38:18.715 --> 00:38:24.680
All right! I'll take you to our playground!

147
00:38:26.515 --> 00:38:27.808
Behold!

148
00:38:32.896 --> 00:38:36.900
Let me introduce your peers!

149
00:38:40.320 --> 00:39:11.894
Even Confucius said if you disregard interaction, you can't expect true growth, right? There are strict code of conduct between men and women. I even brought your wife here. So don't be so harsh. How's our baby? I found a wet nurse, so don't worry.

150
00:39:16.899 --> 00:39:20.358
Until these comforters become consorts,

151
00:39:22.738 --> 00:39:29.912
and lower comforters will be disciplined at nearby temples! Yes, Your Highness!

152
00:39:33.624 --> 00:39:57.898
This is unbearable. Turning universities and temples into comforter training camps! This has gone too far and too long. How long must we wait? Who must we induct? Who else? Prince Jinseong, of course.

153
00:40:00.901 --> 00:40:07.115
Our time will come. People's resentment is getting deeper.

154
00:40:11.912 --> 00:40:17.918
Wake up! Move faster! Hurry!

155
00:40:17.918 --> 00:41:22.524
What makes an ideal woman? Large mouth and clean teeth that can envelop a manhood, long black hair like silk and slender ankles. Satin-like skin and warm body temperature. Full buttocks and thin bones! And what makes a desirable vagina? First, the opening should be near the front. Second, less pubic hair is best, and must be thin and fair. Third, it must always be warm and moist. When it comes to size, it should be just big enough to fit the king's manhood. Sex positions all have one principle to achieve pure bliss through proper contact. How do you consider yourself for the ultimate contact?

156
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:29.406
- Confucius said... - With respect... Aren't we just wet holes for the king to fuck?

157
00:41:30.908 --> 00:41:41.418
We're royal palace piss pots, albeit the best kind. Capable of taking any loads from men of all ages and sorts.

158
00:41:44.213 --> 00:41:49.885
We are like medicine. Using our body to heal another.

159
00:41:50.636 --> 00:41:52.346
That is the real contact.

160
00:41:53.889 --> 00:42:14.368
Very good! Whatever it may be, nobody knows who among you will become consorts or discarded as slaves. Contests and lectures will be held, so do your absolute best. Do you really believe you're a medicine?

161
00:42:15.911 --> 00:42:18.705
I shall teach you how to be one.

162
00:42:20.874 --> 00:42:23.877
How ridiculous, how ridiculous...

163
00:42:23.877 --> 00:42:35.889
The king is a poet, so learn the metaphors. He is a brilliant painter! Use your body to express yourself.

164
00:42:37.891 --> 00:42:47.609
Pierce the moon with your toes! Higher! Raising your heels will develop your pelvic muscles.

165
00:42:49.194 --> 00:43:04.251
Cleaning with unbent knees stimulates the uterus, and tenderizes your inside. Mix sulfur, gemmifera roots, cornus fruit, and cnidium, grind and sift them, then insert it. It'll shrink your vagina and make it more sensitive.

166
00:43:06.879 --> 00:43:12.509
Mix 3 spoons of sulfur in water and wash your privates.

167
00:43:12.885 --> 00:43:16.930
It'll make it like a young girl's. Who's there?

168
00:43:20.893 --> 00:43:25.939
Do not flinch! Feminine energy stems from lower abdomen.

169
00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:34.198
After sensual Taoist trainings,

170
00:43:37.534 --> 00:43:52.883
A butcher who hid her true self, and a concubine who was filled with deep jealousy. Squeeze out the seeds and don't spill a single drop.

171
00:44:00.891 --> 00:44:05.229
Testicles are sensitive, only use tongue to stimulate.

172
00:44:24.873 --> 00:44:31.880
Like a wet cloth, embrace him tightly. Two, uterus must be warm.

173
00:44:32.714 --> 00:44:36.093
Otherwise, there'll be vaginal discharge.

174
00:44:37.845 --> 00:45:02.035
Three. Upon insertion, tighten your vaginal walls Four. When on top, gyrate your hips. Five. Moan seductively under him. Six.

175
00:45:03.328 --> 00:45:06.915
When you don't reach orgasm, he may work too hard for it.

176
00:45:08.959 --> 00:45:15.924
If he ejaculates too early, it could only mean trouble. - So you must climax hastily. - It's all right. It's not all right!

177
00:45:16.675 --> 00:45:18.927
Do not forget these guidelines!

178
00:45:39.531 --> 00:45:46.371
We're not worthy, Your Highness. Pick a dish and introduce yourself.

179
00:45:52.294 --> 00:45:56.298
I'm from deep valleys of Milyang.

180
00:45:56.298 --> 00:46:03.931
Your southern accent will charm us all! You're the Cutie. I am...

181
00:46:05.849 --> 00:46:08.852
Look at her!

182
00:46:08.852 --> 00:46:25.244
I'll call you the Wimp. The Elegant, the Beautiful, the Skilled... The king inspected everyone very carefully, but soon got bored of it, and didn't even bother anymore.

183
00:46:29.456 --> 00:46:31.124
That's her.

184
00:47:03.365 --> 00:47:08.370
With one glimpse, I can tell you are special.

185
00:47:22.676 --> 00:47:29.349
Best of the bunch! I'll see you in the palace soon.

186
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:31.310
Yes, Your Highness.

187
00:47:33.353 --> 00:47:36.315
Anyone else?

188
00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:05.844
I'm Jung-hwa, Neungju Lord JO's daughter.

189
00:48:06.386 --> 00:48:22.027
Do you know what you just ate? It is heifer's uterus, preserved with garlic, a placenta dish. It's my favorite dish. How did it taste?

190
00:48:22.027 --> 00:48:23.987
It was sorrowful.

191
00:48:25.989 --> 00:48:33.163
Sorrowful? Teardrops on a pillow, raindrops on a step stone,

192
00:48:33.997 --> 00:48:44.007
over the window, rain falls all night, and a mother's jacket...

193
00:48:48.428 --> 00:48:50.639
turns crimson.

194
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:14.997
You are... the Master. I am honored, Your Highness.

195
00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:31.138
- Minister IM! - Yes, Your Highness! I want her in the palace right now! - But it is not... - Your Highness. Good things come to those who wait. You should observe until she's ripe. Observe?!

196
00:49:34.975 --> 00:49:37.978
If you so insist.

197
00:49:39.396 --> 00:49:44.860
The fact is, I feel so empty and lonely.

198
00:49:46.528 --> 00:49:52.743
Please rush the training. Yes, Your Highness!

199
00:49:53.994 --> 00:50:03.545
I never anticipated this contest, but of all the girls, why her? You see, it's unfolding as I've told you. Nonsense!

200
00:50:04.379 --> 00:50:13.764
When I think of my life in exile, while her father... Do you think I'd hand over such power to them?

201
00:50:18.977 --> 00:50:23.524
Lord JO's daughter? What a treacherous pair!

202
00:50:24.274 --> 00:50:28.987
How could the IMs support a daughter of their nemesis?

203
00:50:33.992 --> 00:50:37.996
But I can see why he would support her.

204
00:50:39.957 --> 00:50:47.339
Yes, there's something special about her, even her scent is...

205
00:50:47.339 --> 00:50:52.010
Enough! Minister YU!

206
00:50:53.178 --> 00:50:56.557
Get it together! My apologies!

207
00:50:56.557 --> 00:51:02.563
From Neungju, right? Find out more about her. - Certainly. - Right now!

208
00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.983
You better up your game!

209
00:51:12.656 --> 00:51:16.034
Looks like the butchering gave you the edge.

210
00:51:20.622 --> 00:51:32.009
how did you come up with such a poem? Even a lowly girl has good taste buds, I just tried to mimic what I learned. Begin.

211
00:52:31.026 --> 00:52:41.161
and melted his frozen memories.

212
00:53:03.976 --> 00:53:13.277
She was traitor Lord KIM Il-son's daughter Dan-hee.

213
00:54:01.992 --> 00:54:04.119
I'm not worthy, Your Highness.

214
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:12.878
I'll soon open a banquet to test your training.

215
00:54:12.878 --> 00:54:24.806
The winner will not only become my consort, she'll receive a large sum of gold... When I am in the palace, even a million gold coins hold no value.

216
00:54:32.189 --> 00:54:35.609
Then what'd make you happy?

217
00:54:37.361 --> 00:54:42.407
This sword knows the answer, but how could you not?

218
00:54:45.619 --> 00:54:52.668
Minister IM! Soong-jae! Come at once! Right away! - Let's play a game! - Yes, Your Highness.

219
00:54:52.668 --> 00:54:54.670
Come, you adorable things!

220
00:55:01.301 --> 00:55:04.596
Did you notice the way the king looked at Jung-hwa?

221
00:55:08.308 --> 00:55:15.315
We must change our way of thinking. Consort JANG's girl is no ordinary candidate.

222
00:55:15.315 --> 00:55:34.293
We can't lose this to JANG. Rush the liquor serving training so Jung-hwa can move up. She is still far from ready. If we rush this before she's ready... Do you still not know the king? He'll suck her dry and throw her out, it's better to send her in early, and bring about a new change.

223
00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.342
Must Minister YU do this?

224
00:55:47.306 --> 00:55:52.561
Imagine him as the king, and entice him with drinks.

225
00:56:00.319 --> 00:56:01.361
Stop.

226
00:56:07.326 --> 00:56:08.452
Stop.

227
00:56:15.876 --> 00:56:16.919
Stop!

228
00:56:28.514 --> 00:56:29.556
Hear ye!

229
00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:40.317
Maybe you don't look like the king. Remove her at once. SEOL is up next!

230
00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:50.410
May I offer you a precious view?

231
00:56:54.915 --> 00:57:01.797
Your Highness, what do you see? It is a featherless quail!

232
00:57:03.298 --> 00:57:12.850
Your Highness! Now what do you see? It is pink, and wet, like a ripe persimmon.

233
00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:28.740
I shall tell you what it is. What a strange sight, what a bold sight! Like a mouth of an old monk, so bald and toothless!

234
00:57:31.326 --> 00:57:37.124
Like a valley shaped by centuries of rain.

235
00:57:37.124 --> 00:58:13.368
Like a groove in the wood, made by a sharp axe. Like an oasis, it is always wet and flowing. Like an abalone waggling its tongue. Like a large seed inside a dried persimmon. Like a proud rooster with bright comb on its head. An abalone, a persimmon, a rooster and water! It's a magnificent feast!

236
00:58:20.918 --> 00:58:21.919
Enough!

237
00:58:28.717 --> 00:58:31.345
JO Jung-hwa is next!

238
00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:40.521
Minister, we aren't here to save appearances.

239
00:58:40.771 --> 00:58:59.706
May I suggest one of the king's favorite plays? Will you accept? For every drink I down, take an article off. If I pass out before you're naked, you win. If I still stand, your body is mine.

240
00:59:00.749 --> 00:59:08.674
This is not appropriate, please retract. I didn't realize you could be so easily offended.

241
00:59:10.592 --> 00:59:22.104
Please continue. Have you heard of a nut-cruncher? What is it?

242
00:59:22.104 --> 00:59:28.694
It is an old method to tame bulls and hogs.

243
00:59:58.891 --> 01:00:06.773
It is just a hunk of meat, there's no use for the sack. It's a repulsive sack of skin, it's better off gone!

244
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:20.746
You bitch! Even if you are a king, you must treat a lady fairly. You're no different than animals with testicles. What?! Please stop.

245
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:51.693
I'll try again.

246
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:58.700
Murderous intent will blunt your moves.

247
01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:08.710
Have you fallen for her?

248
01:01:15.092 --> 01:01:17.052
We are grooming is a beast, not king.

249
01:01:17.052 --> 01:01:34.194
When we scratch its itch, we're rewarded handsomely. Once that stops, the beast will swallow us whole! Eliminate useless feelings.

250
01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:44.538
Empty your mind! Do you really intend to have me bed him?

251
01:01:45.664 --> 01:01:47.875
Are you training me,

252
01:01:48.709 --> 01:01:52.337
or showing me that you're jealous? Nonsense!

253
01:01:52.337 --> 01:01:56.425
You asked me if I consider myself as medicine.

254
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.844
And what it treats.

255
01:02:00.387 --> 01:02:02.264
I'll answer you now.

256
01:02:08.353 --> 01:02:10.355
I am medicine prescribed to you.

257
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:24.953
Is your daughter still sick?

258
01:02:29.291 --> 01:02:34.922
But I just don't see her around anymore.

259
01:02:48.894 --> 01:02:54.900
You've gone too far this time. What do you mean?

260
01:02:54.900 --> 01:03:05.911
The king's tastes are rather unique. Why is he attracted to whores or butchers?

261
01:03:06.912 --> 01:03:13.877
Perhaps a tyrant and butcher are a match made in heaven.

262
01:03:15.754 --> 01:03:20.551
Hurry up and get ready! Good afternoon, sir.

263
01:03:23.637 --> 01:03:24.972
Looking for this?

264
01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:34.982
Why is it so sharp? Just best prepared for the performance.

265
01:07:09.905 --> 01:07:11.365
Your Highness!

266
01:07:12.741 --> 01:07:15.327
Take him out of here!

267
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:18.330
Hurry!

268
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:42.855
How did you get this? We're on the same boat now, understood?

269
01:07:59.329 --> 01:08:05.377
Plus, she must have been scheming. It had to be done.

270
01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:21.018
Did you... know who she really was? You pathetic idiot! Haven't I warned you? You can't give everything up over petty feelings!

271
01:08:21.018 --> 01:08:32.070
Petty feelings? I am not incompetent like you. What? Obedience and flattery will not work forever.

272
01:08:32.362 --> 01:08:36.325
Why you! When mother committed suicide during exile,

273
01:08:36.909 --> 01:08:48.712
you did nothing but watch. - Shut your mouth! - I'm not like you! I have the power over the king! Because I am king above the king! Shut up!

274
01:08:50.756 --> 01:08:57.763
Keep quiet and watch how I do it. What would you threaten me with?

275
01:08:58.305 --> 01:09:13.779
Forgot what you really gave the king that night? Will you betray your father over a girl? Like father, like son. Like a father who gave up his family for power!

276
01:09:29.711 --> 01:10:02.619
Since you favor Jung-hwa, other comforters may have instigated this... This is treason. How dare you! In king's presence! Minister. Do you really believe that? Your Highness, this has to be treason! What of your reputation if your life was at risk over mere comforters' jealousy? You must wipe out your enemies with this chance.

277
01:10:03.328 --> 01:10:07.457
Who knows? The real perpetrator may be among them.

278
01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:17.217
Bring out the daughters of traitors! This is unfair. Please save me.

279
01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:33.650
Drag her out!

280
01:10:48.832 --> 01:10:58.383
it could lead to death. During exile, my mother didn't want to burden my father, so she drank this.

281
01:10:59.551 --> 01:11:06.016
We obtained power that way, so we ended up like this.

282
01:11:07.434 --> 01:11:30.541
I've told you everything, now it's your turn. Why did you attempt to kill the king? - What do you mean? - I knew Lord KIM Il-son. He was a respected official and an upright man. He was executed for criticizing the king. Please stop. - His remains must be... - Stop!

283
01:11:31.083 --> 01:11:35.671
You do not deserve to utter his name. You must give up your revenge plot.

284
01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:42.678
It's all pointless. For a power chaser, it's all pointless to you.

285
01:11:44.012 --> 01:11:49.351
I will stop you. If you do, you will lose your life.

286
01:11:54.022 --> 01:11:58.569
I will use all my power to get you out.

287
01:12:01.446 --> 01:12:03.490
Is that power...

288
01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:07.244
really yours?

289
01:12:27.431 --> 01:12:38.775
Minister! Minister! Minister! Please save me! This is unfair! Should have been careful, Minister YU!

290
01:12:39.443 --> 01:12:47.784
Soong-jae... For Consort JANG's sake, I'll let you keep your neck, so sit back and rest.

291
01:12:49.745 --> 01:12:53.498
You are all wives and daughters

292
01:12:54.124 --> 01:12:56.835
of those who plotted my death!

293
01:12:56.835 --> 01:13:23.487
You'll be punished accordingly! Have mercy, Your Highness! But you may be pardoned at today's shooting ceremony. And I will accept you back as my comforters. We're eternally grateful! Prime Minister's daughter! Come forward!

294
01:13:40.796 --> 01:13:45.467
I'll aim, you just let the arrow loose.

295
01:14:10.492 --> 01:14:11.535
Remove her! Next!

296
01:14:14.663 --> 01:14:18.709
If you look away, you'll be flagged!

297
01:14:23.005 --> 01:14:24.506
Treason

298
01:14:27.968 --> 01:14:34.975
Left! Next! He embraced the comforters and fired the arrows.

299
01:14:35.684 --> 01:15:00.459
Left! Right! All direct hits, the girls shed tears of blood. A twisted celebration! He danced and jumped in joy, it was a gruesome sight to behold!

300
01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:08.675
He's not it! He's not what?

301
01:15:10.719 --> 01:15:16.099
You were mine all along, Your Highness.

302
01:15:18.101 --> 01:15:20.145
How will you prove it?

303
01:16:09.653 --> 01:16:10.654
Your Highness!

304
01:16:15.868 --> 01:16:16.743
Come on!

305
01:16:17.661 --> 01:16:18.662
Do it!

306
01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.727
Soong-jae, the mood is ruined. Your Highness...

307
01:17:04.917 --> 01:17:09.421
Those who are called are the contest rejects.

308
01:17:09.421 --> 01:17:21.850
You'll be reassigned or become slaves! HAN Ja-soon, HYE Dang-hwa, HYANG Il-hwa, SO Hyang, SEOL, and JO Jung-hwa.

309
01:17:40.035 --> 01:17:42.079
Stupid whore.

310
01:17:42.454 --> 01:17:46.500
Please ask Consort JANG and put me back in.

311
01:17:47.334 --> 01:18:01.390
You want to be back in the contest? Rumor says, a traitor's daughter is a comforter. She was put in that place by someone high up.

312
01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:11.191
Your Highness, may your loyal subject speak?

313
01:18:12.442 --> 01:18:44.725
The contest may be ruined, but a winner must be decided. And she must fulfill her duty. What should I do? Result is important, but so is the process. I asked the head trainer to recommend the best one. But, she came up with two names instead.

314
01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:56.528
Two names? Then pit them against each other. Ergo, I had them brought here.

315
01:18:56.528 --> 01:18:57.988
Bring them in!

316
01:19:04.244 --> 01:19:07.039
All right, show your faces.

317
01:19:13.837 --> 01:19:19.009
Your Highness! They no longer have any right to compete.

318
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:40.822
and had been outstanding candidates, so if they're deprived of their chance, how can we say that we're selecting the best? - Your Highness! - Enough! I was sorry to let them go. Let's have a final match!

319
01:19:41.156 --> 01:19:53.669
Yes, Your Highness. - You're a schemer! - Why're you so enraged? It's not like she'll die in his bed.

320
01:19:54.294 --> 01:20:00.300
Or can you not love someone tainted by the king?

321
01:20:03.011 --> 01:20:08.016
Must you be so cruel? No matter what, you can't have her.

322
01:20:09.309 --> 01:20:17.901
She has no feelings for you. Why not just take her? That's more like you. Love isn't your style.

323
01:20:20.737 --> 01:20:25.367
I will set you straight, even if I have to kill you!

324
01:20:27.035 --> 01:20:30.163
I'll look forward to it, my Lord.

325
01:21:08.202 --> 01:21:14.583
Life itself is prison for me. I'll take whatever punishment. Fine, if that's your wish.

326
01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:19.338
This is the final lesson. Strip. - Lord! - It's an order!

327
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:30.224
Lose, you'll die, win, you won't survive.

328
01:21:33.727 --> 01:21:37.022
Remember this sensation with your body.

329
01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:46.365
Be aroused first, and you lose. Not aroused, you lose.

330
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:51.870
and you become the best.

331
01:22:27.239 --> 01:22:35.038
Do you still entertain such futile hope? I promised never to get you killed.

332
01:22:36.039 --> 01:22:44.047
Fate played tricks on us. I owe you nothing. Such warmth from a cold heart.

333
01:22:45.966 --> 01:23:11.491
Even if my body isn't, my heart is frozen solid. I will have you and melt your heart. Even if it does beat, I will not become yours. Tell me, that you'll stop. Just tell me. Prove it with your life, then I will say it.

334
01:23:45.609 --> 01:23:59.039
I'm bored. One cannot claim to be the best by killing a few soldiers. One must defeat the enemy general.

335
01:24:01.625 --> 01:24:08.048
A tiger and a phoenix. Seduce each other before me.

336
01:24:11.593 --> 01:24:17.975
I will award the winner with the loser's pretty head.

337
01:24:22.563 --> 01:24:27.401
Your Highness, this is against nature.

338
01:24:33.073 --> 01:24:37.369
We've forbid any contact between comforters...

339
01:24:38.787 --> 01:24:42.791
Must I cut off your tongue?

340
01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:37.679
That's it! So Soong-jae trained Jung-hwa?

341
01:26:04.998 --> 01:26:06.959
That's right.

342
01:26:14.258 --> 01:26:15.300
Bit more.

343
01:26:20.931 --> 01:26:22.933
That's right!

344
01:26:40.617 --> 01:26:42.870
Jung-hwa, concentrate!

345
01:26:47.791 --> 01:26:49.084
Good!

346
01:26:55.757 --> 01:26:57.718
Oh come on.

347
01:26:59.219 --> 01:27:01.555
Flip over, flip!

348
01:27:03.557 --> 01:27:05.559
Don't lose, keep going!

349
01:27:06.185 --> 01:27:10.939
Seek your chance! Keep going, harder!

350
01:27:28.498 --> 01:27:32.503
Concentrate! Keep going!

351
01:27:34.463 --> 01:27:36.507
We're almost there!

352
01:27:39.968 --> 01:27:44.139
Try harder. Harder.

353
01:28:03.825 --> 01:28:09.289
It is pitiful and desperate.

354
01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:51.498
A struggle towards the sun. Venting with a dagger in hand. The dragon's hand swings ferociously, and the snake's tongue remains silent. Soong-jae! This is what I've been waiting for! Be aroused first, you lose, not aroused, you still lose. Control your own senses, and you become the best.

355
01:29:34.499 --> 01:29:40.547
Didn't you promise me a pretty head? And I'm fulfilling that now.

356
01:29:40.547 --> 01:29:41.840
Let the girl go.

357
01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:46.803
But she won't be pretty if dead. What?

358
01:30:02.110 --> 01:30:09.243
- Your Highness... - Make SEOL her slave and I'll bed the winner tomorrow.

359
01:30:14.498 --> 01:30:16.500
Let's go another round.

360
01:30:23.507 --> 01:30:27.761
Delicate flower, with its crimson radiance,

361
01:30:29.555 --> 01:30:45.487
greets the young east forgetting to bloom. Is the sky dark blinded by madness? Or is the sky turned dark by a bleak mind?

362
01:31:03.297 --> 01:31:07.259
Now, as promised, let's hear your request.

363
01:31:09.511 --> 01:31:13.182
Please select another girl as your new consort.

364
01:31:17.477 --> 01:31:22.524
Are you in love with her? Do you remember when we were young?

365
01:31:25.235 --> 01:31:43.504
Even if it wasn't fit for a boy. Yes, we were close as these balls. So I beg of you, give her to me! How dare you! Coveting a king's property is punishable by death!

366
01:31:45.047 --> 01:31:53.305
Answer me this. Do you desire her at the risk of your life?

367
01:32:08.028 --> 01:32:14.701
No sane man can live through this turbulent age.

368
01:32:16.411 --> 01:32:22.876
Turbulent age? My madness has turned the sky black!

369
01:32:24.837 --> 01:32:30.509
Will you stop me? Even after deflowering thousands,

370
01:32:32.469 --> 01:32:40.561
the ghosts of the dead won't leave me! I've gone utterly insane!

371
01:32:59.288 --> 01:33:03.125
Go on. Please stop me.

372
01:33:05.043 --> 01:33:12.092
Your Majesty, kill me instead! No, no!

373
01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:31.361
How can I kill a loyal subject? You couldn't fulfill your duty due to my lack of virtue! Stop me... Please! Please! Your Highness!

374
01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:36.033
Let go!

375
01:33:46.502 --> 01:33:50.756
Who dared to bother my little baby. My baby.

376
01:33:56.553 --> 01:33:59.634
That's it, everything's all right.

377
01:34:03.769 --> 01:34:07.314
I'll take care of him, leave us now.

378
01:35:32.983 --> 01:35:33.984
But how...

379
01:36:15.776 --> 01:36:18.195
Make no mistake.

380
01:36:50.727 --> 01:36:54.523
Even the new consort.

381
01:37:11.915 --> 01:37:16.628
I too felt the same.

382
01:37:49.494 --> 01:37:50.537
A riddle?

383
01:37:51.914 --> 01:38:00.756
Go on then. It normally floats, but sinks at times. You have 3 chances to solve it.

384
01:38:59.857 --> 01:39:04.528
Your Highness! You really don't know?

385
01:39:09.575 --> 01:39:11.577
Or a palanquin?

386
01:39:50.032 --> 01:39:55.037
I shall ride you, you're my boat today!

387
01:39:58.582 --> 01:40:01.460
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

388
01:40:03.212 --> 01:40:09.426
It keeps a boat afloat or sinks it. It is water.

389
01:40:10.052 --> 01:40:16.725
It is said, the people is water, the king is the boat. You're the boat that the water will sink today!

390
01:41:00.477 --> 01:41:01.520
Bring him in.

391
01:41:07.609 --> 01:41:10.487
Lord JO, is this your daughter?

392
01:41:14.533 --> 01:41:19.371
Spare me, Your Highness. Please...

393
01:41:21.748 --> 01:41:26.378
Please speak on my behalf! How could we...

394
01:41:27.838 --> 01:41:29.089
Next.

395
01:41:33.677 --> 01:41:38.307
My lady, glad to see you alive.

396
01:41:40.058 --> 01:41:46.398
You there, is this your daughter?

397
01:41:49.026 --> 01:41:55.490
No better than a mad butcher! Get a grip! Please!

398
01:41:58.076 --> 01:41:59.077
Next.

399
01:42:14.718 --> 01:42:19.097
I'll ask for the last time.

400
01:42:19.097 --> 01:42:22.434
Is she your daughter?

401
01:42:23.227 --> 01:42:26.897
Lord KIM Il-son! Father...

402
01:42:26.897 --> 01:42:28.524
Why are you silent?

403
01:42:33.862 --> 01:42:36.907
So disloyal!

404
01:42:40.410 --> 01:42:43.872
Why! Why?!

405
01:42:50.337 --> 01:42:52.256
You are pathetic.

406
01:42:58.428 --> 01:43:11.066
with your eyes and ears shut, who'll tell you the truth? What is the truth you're so desperate to tell? Go on, tell me.

407
01:43:11.567 --> 01:43:17.531
Become a human, if not a king.

408
01:43:35.132 --> 01:43:52.149
I am solely to be blamed for my son's faults. Please take my life and forgive him! Forgive? How can I forgive anyone, when I can't even recognize my mother's belongings?

409
01:43:53.859 --> 01:44:23.222
Remember this? A symbol of our relationship. Without this, I'd still be a plaything for her enemies. So let me ask, why'd you bring me this? I was sincerely looking after your well-being... My well-being? I used it to solidify my throne, and you regained power.

410
01:44:24.014 --> 01:44:29.269
Your sincerity is noted. So can I throw it away now?

411
01:44:33.607 --> 01:44:34.525
Your Highness!

412
01:44:35.108 --> 01:44:42.276
But it's your mother's article! It's my mother's, so why do you care?

413
01:44:43.867 --> 01:44:48.288
The late king worried about seeds of trouble,

414
01:44:49.831 --> 01:44:57.339
so any articles that belonged to the queen were all destroyed.

415
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:02.261
Father...

416
01:45:09.476 --> 01:45:12.306
Did you really took me for a fool?

417
01:45:12.479 --> 01:45:57.566
The late queen was indeed killed by conspiracy... I'll ask again! When a king makes an error, should his subjects object, or should they comply for the fear of their lives? A loyal subject should... Pandering to my needs, regardless of its consequences, you're a treacherous subject! You blinded me with flattery, you're a traitor who ruined this nation! Your Highness! Please take my life! No loyal servants exist in my court,

418
01:45:58.650 --> 01:46:07.868
only faithful dogs. But a dog should not be put down over one bite.

419
01:46:28.889 --> 01:46:32.476
and his son, who offered his lover.

420
01:46:37.898 --> 01:46:41.860
What will you do for me now?

421
01:46:45.572 --> 01:46:48.617
Can you bring me paint for the drawing?

422
01:47:51.096 --> 01:47:55.851
This is my reward to you, so retain your loyalty.

423
01:47:59.521 --> 01:48:06.570
And recruit for the next group of comforters. No mistakes this time. Yes, Your Majesty.

424
01:48:43.982 --> 01:48:47.569
That is the reason why I kept you alive.

425
01:48:55.702 --> 01:48:57.120
This was your sister's,

426
01:49:02.918 --> 01:49:06.588
to avenge a sister who met a shameful death.

427
01:49:08.799 --> 01:49:16.348
Shouldn't have trusted a whore. Care for an amusement?

428
01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:21.270
When blood river soaks the dry land,

429
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:25.566
old boat's clamors shake the world! Cowardly boatman!

430
01:49:25.566 --> 01:49:28.944
Seize the moment to build a new boat!

431
01:49:31.864 --> 01:49:35.909
Treacherous words from a treacherous subject.

432
01:49:38.829 --> 01:49:49.548
Round everyone up! Close the door, another purge is coming! Hide yourself, they'll take you away!

433
01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:58.557
You are all pigs! Fattened up on the king's lands, and offered back to the king!

434
01:49:58.557 --> 01:50:03.020
That is the very reason of your life!

435
01:50:04.521 --> 01:50:39.598
Peasant blood and sweat fueled the king's madness, it knew no boundary. If the screams of his populace don't stop his dance, he must be stopped at any cost. When IM returns with new comforters, public's rage will be at its limit, we'll start the rebellion. You bastards! Heaven will judge you. Go to hell, you bastards! Don't you have family?!

436
01:51:00.869 --> 01:51:03.330
Why is everyone so desperate to die?

437
01:51:25.894 --> 01:51:31.525
Where is everyone? Due to long travel, I've allowed them to rest.

438
01:51:33.527 --> 01:51:38.031
They will look better when they are rested.

439
01:51:40.492 --> 01:51:50.460
All right, I can wait a night. You must also be tired, so rest up.

440
01:51:52.171 --> 01:51:58.135
Go now. Take a rest. Thank you, Your Highness.

441
01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:06.226
Anyone there?

442
01:52:12.441 --> 01:52:21.992
I wish to see the comforters now. But I must alert the security guards... You can be my security detail! Get ready at once!

443
01:52:22.492 --> 01:52:26.622
Your Highness, Minister IM is here.

444
01:52:29.541 --> 01:53:02.991
Soong-jae! If you had everything ready, you should've told me before I got drunk. Forgive me. I was too conscious of others. It's okay, very good. Everyone's so afraid of me, always, 'Your Highness!' Shut the hell up! Damn it! - Soong-jae! - Yes, bud! Let's have some real fun, like we did as kids!

445
01:53:21.969 --> 01:53:37.568
What's going on? Don't joke around! Do you remember? The girl role play, that you liked? What? Now, you take the role that I always had to play.

446
01:53:39.236 --> 01:53:45.993
You must be mad! If you want it intact, hide it.

447
01:53:54.042 --> 01:53:56.044
What's going on?!

448
01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:08.724
Don't be upset over the past. I understand, I'll forget about this.

449
01:54:09.850 --> 01:54:11.101
So sheath your sword.

450
01:54:14.813 --> 01:54:16.523
Sheath your sword!

451
01:54:18.483 --> 01:54:25.157
The world will be better off without it. Fine, fine.

452
01:54:25.490 --> 01:54:28.035
You think I won't do it? I will...

453
01:55:08.992 --> 01:55:12.329
Contempt for the king won't go unpunished!

454
01:55:12.329 --> 01:55:18.001
I only see a murderer, so where is the king?

455
01:55:38.105 --> 01:55:58.834
Why are you doing this? Evil wins power, so all desire to be more evil. It's the source of our tragedy, and what tortures your soul! I shall uproot it. Even if I die, you can't take my place! Friend! Evil is replaced by a greater evil.

456
01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:03.297
You underestimate me!

457
01:56:09.011 --> 01:56:15.017
Your Highness. I'll bring out the comforters, and leave you be.

458
01:56:15.601 --> 01:56:28.197
Pale skin, full buttocks, sharp nose tip. They fit your taste, so please fulfill your duty as a king. You bastard!

459
01:56:29.489 --> 01:56:32.034
Stop right there!

460
01:57:10.781 --> 01:57:11.990
Let's go!

461
01:57:18.956 --> 01:57:22.709
We must take the palace!

462
01:57:23.377 --> 01:57:25.420
Captain!

463
01:57:28.090 --> 01:57:33.679
Minister YU, you brought reinforcement. We can't last very long this way. Still no orders from the king?

464
01:57:33.679 --> 01:57:36.181
He's nowhere to be found.

465
01:57:40.185 --> 01:57:44.356
The palace gate is open! Advance!

466
01:57:51.196 --> 01:57:53.198
What took you so long?

467
01:57:53.198 --> 01:57:57.244
I want nothing more than to save this country!

468
01:57:58.203 --> 01:58:00.622
I heard that fox Soong-jae visited you.

469
01:58:01.206 --> 01:58:05.252
How can you lead the uprising with his help?

470
01:58:11.842 --> 01:58:15.220
And, I know I'm late to the party,

471
01:58:19.725 --> 01:58:21.185
Advance!

472
01:58:26.273 --> 01:58:31.236
IM Soong-jae!

473
01:58:33.947 --> 01:58:54.426
Are you not afraid of the heavens?! Do you not know who I am?! Of course we do! A former concubine, who feeds off the populace, you're just a temptress who fueled tyranny! Take her out! You're just a pathetic pawn! I was a loyal subject...

474
01:58:55.552 --> 01:58:57.429
Die, you bitch!

475
01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:32.589
you call this shame? It wouldn't be enough to rip you to shreds!

476
01:59:38.512 --> 01:59:41.849
What are you waiting for? Kill me!

477
01:59:58.448 --> 02:00:01.243
how am I any different from the mad king?

478
02:00:03.370 --> 02:00:09.251
If you could at least laugh at me... Stay alive.

479
02:00:10.586 --> 02:00:17.759
Your sins will not wash away so easily. Survive and live to undo all your wrongs.

480
02:00:18.218 --> 02:00:19.928
Undo everything.

481
02:00:22.723 --> 02:00:26.727
Majesty, I'll take care of her, please stay back!

482
02:00:33.233 --> 02:00:40.657
Why're you wearing the king's robe? I am playing my part as the treacherous subject.

483
02:00:40.657 --> 02:01:04.181
What have you done to deserve it?! A hero is a nobody during peace, and a moral man is useless on the battlefield. What's the difference? Father! No, my son. It's not too late. Where did you hide the king? We should kill him first! Power cannot be contained. Nonsense!

484
02:01:04.181 --> 02:01:20.822
Like you said, we can build a higher levee! Have you gone blind? You're the blind one! I know you started everything for that bitch! Move aside, I'll kill her and bring you back! Enough!

485
02:01:21.782 --> 02:01:26.745
This is the only way for me as your son.

486
02:01:32.751 --> 02:01:34.795
No, no, please!

487
02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:56.817
Soong-jae, my son! For upholding tyranny, creating a mad king, blinding you with power, being a terrible son, I'll pay for it all.

488
02:01:58.527 --> 02:02:05.117
Please... No, you have to live!

489
02:02:05.117 --> 02:02:08.245
How can I face your mother if you die like this?

490
02:02:08.245 --> 02:02:13.625
- No, please! - Fools... How did you not know?

491
02:02:19.673 --> 02:02:22.342
You destroyed both of us.

492
02:03:00.005 --> 02:03:05.969
Drinking bud, it will only end by taking my life, right?

493
02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:13.977
Do you have a last wish? Take that whore, and send her far away.

494
02:03:14.978 --> 02:03:17.022
She's rather irritating.

495
02:03:34.998 --> 02:03:41.505
I had the king and the world at my fingertips.

496
02:03:42.631 --> 02:03:51.974
I had my share of the world. Your vile reputation will last a millennium.

497
02:03:57.729 --> 02:04:00.983
The king is not here, move out!

498
02:04:56.955 --> 02:05:01.335
Go on and take them.

499
02:05:06.006 --> 02:05:11.428
The pigs had the last laugh!

500
02:05:15.974 --> 02:05:19.770
SEPT. 2, 1506 A.D. After Joseon's first uprising,

501
02:05:37.037 --> 02:05:44.419
Not quite selection process, but exercising power that was given.

502
02:05:45.212 --> 02:05:48.006
How could I best explain this?

503
02:05:49.758 --> 02:05:52.261
So what happened to the mad king in the end?

504
02:05:52.261 --> 02:06:09.194
Haven't you been listening? His sexual appetite got him banished, so comforters were what got him killed! Good riddance! Tell us once more about how the treacherous IMs were killed! Yeah!

505
02:06:11.196 --> 02:06:18.579
The IMs tried to help a concubine, and the two were found in ashes.

506
02:06:20.539 --> 02:06:22.749
Do that to me too!

507
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:31.008
Their ashes were spitted on, and they deserved the worst fate in the world.

508
02:06:32.843 --> 02:06:36.763
If your drinks are empty, get going! Hurry!

509
02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:41.810
It's here! It's starting!

510
02:06:59.286 --> 02:07:18.805
the two IMs were up to no good, so desperate to get on the king's good side, can't just let this cruelty continue! The enraged mountain god sent a tiger!

511
02:07:21.517 --> 02:07:28.732
I'm gonna hurt my back! Empty your pockets!

512
02:07:33.445 --> 02:07:39.243
It searched the world for deluded subjects,

513
02:07:39.243 --> 02:07:57.719
It searched and searched but could not find them. Hidden behind a human mask, can't tell what's in his heart. All right, feed on my body,

514
02:07:57.719 --> 02:08:06.770
and if you're a good man, I'll strengthen your body, or I'll become poison and kill you.

515
02:08:14.736 --> 02:08:16.989
I found you!
