2
00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.369
Mom!

3
00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:55.916
Mom, Mom!

4
00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.987
48 minutes and 37 seconds.

5
00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:04.691
You took frigging long.
I could've been dead by now!

6
00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.627
God damn it!

7
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.496
What happened?

8
00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:11.265
What do you think?

9
00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.134
It was a test to see
how fast youd get here.

10
00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:19.106
This whole thing was a test?

11
00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:20.140
Listen.

12
00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:24.344
A constant effort is needed
to protect our family.

13
00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:28.615
You should be ready
at all times. Got it?

14
00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:32.219
You have no faith in me.

15
00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.822
Its not that.
Your big brother did it, too.

16
00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:39.860
Really?
How long did it take him?

17
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.064
Less than 30 minutes.
And he came alone.

18
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:48.368
I cant believe
you brought two minions.

19
00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:52.539
Theres no comparison, Mom.

20
00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.708
Im no match for him.

21
00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.076
Youre right on that.

22
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.084
- You know what? I miss him.


23
00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:06.787
Mom!

24
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.858
Mom!

25
00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:14.228
What the hell happened?

26
00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:15.729
Save it!

27
00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:19.366
Whats this?
What the hell were you doing?

28
00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.601
Beats me.

29
00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:22.836
-Youre pathetic.
-It hurts.

30
00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:26.206
Stop planting trees around.

31
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.843
Youll build a forest
before you know it.

32
00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:33.847
Youre beyond help, SOB!
Get a life!

33
00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:41.488
Who was it?
Who kidnapped Mom?

34
00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:46.260
Its over, Bro.
Go finish planting a tree.

35
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.534
Im always left in the dark.

36
00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:41.882
Give it to me, Babe
Give it to me, Babe

37
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.518
Put it on a vibrating mode.

38
00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:48.522
Boss.

39
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.158
Its time to go.

40
00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:13.247
This is my favorite song.

41
00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:16.016
- I know no songs.
- What?

42
00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:20.354
You must be too busy
with your business

43
00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:25.492
I like hard-working men
like yourself.

44
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:32.032
I go to work at 2 p.m.
and get off at 6.

45
00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:35.135
God, thats a life.

46
00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:38.705
I dont like a hectic life.

47
00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:40.974
I like taking it easy.

48
00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:45.712
And I drink every night.

49
00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.217
Drinking?
I absolutely love it.

50
00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:54.421
5 shots of boilermaker
get me, though.

51
00:05:54.655 --> 00:05:56.089
Like a blinking light.

52
00:06:02.763 --> 00:06:04.665
Hyo-jung, right?

53
00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:09.236
- Do you have time?
- A lot.

54
00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:13.173
What about pride?

55
00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:16.009
None.

56
00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.879
Youre senseless,
and Im rude.

57
00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:21.448
Lets not waste time.

58
00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.083
Excuse me.

59
00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:33.694
Shit!

60
00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:40.133
What couldve gone wrong?

61
00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:42.102
Im sorry.

62
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.776
Hes so cool.

63
00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:04.825
Whats wrong with her?

64
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:09.596
What kind of chick
would you like?

65
00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:14.368
Let me tell you.
Youre too picky with girls.

66
00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:18.272
Youll never know.

67
00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:20.607
Okay?

68
00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:01.181
You okay, Boss?

69
00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:03.917
You bastard!

70
00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:33.747
Hi.

71
00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:43.757
Hi, Miss Prosecutor.

72
00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:47.694
Let go!

73
00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:52.332
Bingo!

74
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.704
A padded bra?

75
00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:03.744
What do you take yourself for?
A utility pole?

76
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:06.246
Have a seat.

77
00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:27.568
Its all there.

78
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.337
You cant bribe me
with that.

79
00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.206
No way.

80
00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:36.443
Ill have a box full of cash
delivered to you.

81
00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:41.315
You dont get it, do you?
Money wont do.

82
00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:45.586
Especially if its from
a thug like you.

83
00:09:45.953 --> 00:09:49.590
You came to return the money,
wearing a wire?

84
00:09:50.123 --> 00:09:51.525
To bust my ass?

85
00:09:51.525 --> 00:09:52.726
Let me tell you.

86
00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:57.164
I always check faces of those
that Im arresting.

87
00:09:57.164 --> 00:10:02.469
Dont be so uptight.
Have some juice and relax.

88
00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.739
Well talk then.

89
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.525
Thought Id drink it?

90
00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:28.462
I know your trick.

91
00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:30.831
You put drugs in it!

92
00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:32.666
You got me there.

93
00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:38.438
I thought you might like
getting high.

94
00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:41.775
-You son of a...
-Gulp it down.

95
00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:48.048
Once you get high,
my boys will gang-bang you.

96
00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:50.984
What?
A gangbang?

97
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.587
Why upset?

98
00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:58.759
After the gangbang,
well sell you off to an island.

99
00:10:58.759 --> 00:10:59.526
Hey!

100
00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:04.731
Im KIM Jin-kyung,
a prosecutor of violent crimes!

101
00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:07.968
A gangbang?

102
00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.404
Ill break your skull!

103
00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:12.840
Sell me off to an island?

104
00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:17.511
What the fuck do you take
a prosecutor for?!

105
00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:20.080
Ill kick your ass!

106
00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:25.719
You drank it.

107
00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:41.768
Youre... dead meat.

108
00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:47.407
Strip her and take pictures.

109
00:11:47.608 --> 00:11:48.708
My pleasure.

110
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.948
Bitch!

111
00:11:58.352 --> 00:11:59.586
Hot!

112
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.604
Get her!

113
00:12:39.393 --> 00:12:42.796
God damn it!
See which floor she gets off!

114
00:12:56.944 --> 00:12:59.580
Mister, help me.

115
00:13:00.948 --> 00:13:03.417
Miss!
Are you okay?

116
00:13:04.518 --> 00:13:07.821
Wake up, Miss.
Miss?

117
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:16.763
Mind your own business
and hit the road.

118
00:13:17.197 --> 00:13:18.966
I cant do that.

119
00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:20.667
Youll regret it.

120
00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:23.270
Beat it before I make you.

121
00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:25.606
Asshole!

122
00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:18.692
You son of a bitch!

123
00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:35.342
Whats going on here?

124
00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:38.278
Whend you become a cop?

125
00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:41.815
I bought it at the market.

126
00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:45.452
Anyway,
who were those fucks?

127
00:15:13.814 --> 00:15:15.315
It stinks!

128
00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:25.259
Why strip her?

129
00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:28.762
Look at this.
I had no choice.

130
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.708
Have fun, Boss.

131
00:15:56.023 --> 00:15:58.091
So strange.

132
00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.628
Shes a carbon copy
of Jin-sook.

133
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:06.834
This tearoom is so nice.

134
00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:09.870
This is the coolest one
in Seoul.

135
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:14.107
Its called a caf up here,
not a tearoom.

136
00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:15.876
A caf?

137
00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:18.078
What does it mean?
To hit?

138
00:16:19.213 --> 00:16:20.414
No.

139
00:16:20.848 --> 00:16:23.317
A place to drink coffee.

140
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:29.489
Man, youre such a genius.

141
00:16:29.756 --> 00:16:31.391
Ready to order?

142
00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:44.238
Shit, its all in English.

143
00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:47.407
Coffee will do for me.
Make it cold.

144
00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:49.309
You want an iced coffee?

145
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.547
- No, a cold coffee.
- Yes, an iced coffee.

146
00:16:53.547 --> 00:16:57.384
No, a cold coffee
with ice in it!

147
00:16:57.918 --> 00:17:00.587
- Make it ice-cold.
- Beat it!

148
00:17:01.955 --> 00:17:05.158
I cant believe that bitch.

149
00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:10.063
Why cant she just get us
what we order?

150
00:17:10.063 --> 00:17:12.399
They must be out
of cold coffee.

151
00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:21.508
Whats this?

152
00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:24.278
You do have a cold coffee.
Whyd you lie?

153
00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:27.548
She mustve borrowed some
from next door.

154
00:17:29.283 --> 00:17:30.584
Wait.

155
00:17:31.752 --> 00:17:32.953
We didnt order this.

156
00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:37.624
They give you an extra
here in Seoul.

157
00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:42.296
-So its like a baby?
-Thats right.

158
00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:49.670
- Too sweet!
- Youre sweeter!

159
00:17:50.704 --> 00:17:52.973
She made it too sweet.

160
00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:55.375
Too bitter!

161
00:17:56.176 --> 00:17:58.111
That bitch ruined it.

162
00:17:58.412 --> 00:17:59.680
So bitter.

163
00:19:15.022 --> 00:19:17.391
You had a close call.

164
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:21.828
Its not broken, is it?

165
00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:26.700
Penis never gets broken,
but torn off.

166
00:19:27.034 --> 00:19:30.671
Some ignorant thugs say,
My cock is broken.

167
00:19:31.038 --> 00:19:33.841
But let me tell you.
Thats just plain wrong.

168
00:19:34.041 --> 00:19:35.442
Okay.

169
00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:40.247
But its...

170
00:19:42.683 --> 00:19:44.184
Oh, these metal balls?

171
00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:49.356
I had to remove them
for the procedure.

172
00:19:49.623 --> 00:19:50.657
How many?

173
00:19:51.258 --> 00:19:55.495
2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
You put in so many.

174
00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:02.002
We dont use these cheap,
low-quality balls.

175
00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:05.839
A lot of side effects,
and very bad for your body.

176
00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:07.608
I see.

177
00:20:08.442 --> 00:20:14.348
At our hospital, we only use
top-quality metal balls.

178
00:20:14.715 --> 00:20:17.451
You want them inserted?

179
00:20:18.018 --> 00:20:22.122
No. I think I can do
without them.

180
00:20:22.422 --> 00:20:23.724
Suit yourself.

181
00:20:24.424 --> 00:20:26.560
Until your penis heals...

182
00:20:29.696 --> 00:20:33.233
You need to keep this on
for a few days.

183
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.039
Should I put it on you?

184
00:21:00.561 --> 00:21:04.798
Once you get high,
my boys will gang-bang you.

185
00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:10.804
After the gangbang,
Ill sell you off to an island.

186
00:22:04.591 --> 00:22:06.059
Werent you cold?

187
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:08.695
Who are you?

188
00:22:09.263 --> 00:22:11.832
Why are you naked?
Do you know who I am?

189
00:22:11.832 --> 00:22:13.166
Thats...

190
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.501
Answer me now!

191
00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:18.405
You dont remember?
Last night in the parking lot...

192
00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:22.676
The parking lot?
What did you do to me?

193
00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:28.815
Nothing. You were unconscious,
and I didnt know where you live.

194
00:22:28.815 --> 00:22:33.587
So you brought me here?

195
00:22:34.555 --> 00:22:36.723
Its not what you think.

196
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:42.329
You touched me, didnt you?
Youre dead!

197
00:22:43.063 --> 00:22:46.166
I never touched you!

198
00:22:48.635 --> 00:22:50.604
You did me with
that ugly thing!

199
00:22:57.878 --> 00:23:00.180
Nothing happened.
Trust me.

200
00:23:00.981 --> 00:23:03.550
Stay back, or Ill kill you.

201
00:23:03.917 --> 00:23:07.087
Where are my clothes?
Bring them!

202
00:23:30.544 --> 00:23:31.812
Is she okay?

203
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:37.184
Damn!

204
00:23:48.061 --> 00:23:51.932
You plant trees
in and out of the house.

205
00:23:52.232 --> 00:23:54.635
You should be awarded.

206
00:23:54.635 --> 00:24:00.174
Arbor Day isnt the only day
to plant trees.

207
00:24:02.376 --> 00:24:04.845
Im a bare mountain.

208
00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:11.985
Youre overdoing it again.
Okay, fine.

209
00:24:12.653 --> 00:24:14.855
Ill turn you into a jungle.

210
00:24:17.324 --> 00:24:20.093
Good morning, Sir.

211
00:24:40.714 --> 00:24:42.282
Lets see.

212
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.655
Was it good, Boss?

213
00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:52.526
Its not that.

214
00:24:53.861 --> 00:24:57.030
Dont be shy with me.

215
00:24:58.732 --> 00:25:01.034
Nothing happened.

216
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:03.537
No shit.

217
00:25:05.305 --> 00:25:07.407
Hows that possible?

218
00:25:07.741 --> 00:25:12.613
You remember my ex,
Jin-sook?

219
00:25:13.247 --> 00:25:16.984
One with a crazy perm?
Yeah, I remember her.

220
00:25:17.084 --> 00:25:19.253
Doesnt she look like her?

221
00:25:20.053 --> 00:25:22.523
- Very much so, Boss.
- Right.

222
00:25:23.023 --> 00:25:29.429
So you banged her all night
until your cock got swollen?

223
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:33.233
I said nothing happened.

224
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.435
Pull your pants up.

225
00:25:35.569 --> 00:25:36.170
Okay.

226
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:38.872
And...

227
00:25:40.507 --> 00:25:42.209
- Come here.
- Okay.

228
00:25:44.011 --> 00:25:46.847
Your damn fly is open.

229
00:25:47.381 --> 00:25:49.750
- Let me zip it.
- You cant go in there!

230
00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:02.095
- How are you?
- Who are you?

231
00:26:02.095 --> 00:26:05.165
Were social workers
from Share Love.

232
00:26:05.265 --> 00:26:06.867
So what?

233
00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:11.738
You can help the needy
and share love.

234
00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:15.609
So youre saying
you wanna help the poor...

235
00:26:16.109 --> 00:26:17.678
By extorting money from us?

236
00:26:17.778 --> 00:26:22.983
Thats not it.
If you make a donation...

237
00:26:23.083 --> 00:26:25.586
Thats extortion!

238
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:31.024
You bastard!
Let me teach you who we are.

239
00:26:31.225 --> 00:26:32.326
Jong-myun.

240
00:26:32.826 --> 00:26:36.597
Once we help them,
theyll come back for more.

241
00:26:36.597 --> 00:26:40.501
Life is pain.
They need to be independent.

242
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:43.971
You dont watch the news?

243
00:26:44.204 --> 00:26:48.242
That famous doctor has
succeeded in copying humans...
...and Babel Prize...


245
00:26:51.311 --> 00:26:52.179
Son of a bitch!

246
00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:53.814
- Hey.
- Yes, Boss?

247
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:55.449
Youre not making sense.

248
00:26:55.449 --> 00:26:57.885
Im sorry.
He got me too upset.

249
00:26:59.786 --> 00:27:00.587
Come here.

250
00:27:01.722 --> 00:27:02.523
Okay.

251
00:27:10.264 --> 00:27:11.331
1 grand?!

252
00:27:15.402 --> 00:27:19.706
Heres my name card.
Call me anytime.

253
00:27:19.706 --> 00:27:23.610
I can drop by and tell you
all about our work.

254
00:27:25.212 --> 00:27:28.448
Your family name is JANG.
Family origin?

255
00:27:29.416 --> 00:27:31.051
Its Ik-san.

256
00:27:31.318 --> 00:27:33.921
Really?
Me, too!

257
00:27:34.021 --> 00:27:38.192
Is that right?
What family are you from?

258
00:27:38.492 --> 00:27:41.528
- White Tiger Family.
- White tiger?

259
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:44.865
Wanna join the family?

260
00:27:45.632 --> 00:27:47.167
Good with knives?

261
00:27:48.168 --> 00:27:50.404
Thank you.
Bye.

262
00:27:51.104 --> 00:27:52.539
Nice meeting you.

263
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.413
We JANGs are all handsome.

264
00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.789
-Jin-kyung!
-BONG.

265
00:28:09.556 --> 00:28:12.426
What happened last night?
Are you okay?

266
00:28:12.759 --> 00:28:14.828
You got me worried sick.

267
00:28:16.096 --> 00:28:17.664
Im fine, am I not?

268
00:28:18.398 --> 00:28:21.001
Youre gonna let them go?

269
00:28:21.301 --> 00:28:24.671
No way.
Pick them up right now.

270
00:28:24.838 --> 00:28:29.176
A little bird told me that
they traffic drugs.

271
00:28:29.643 --> 00:28:32.446
Im waiting for a bigger bust.

272
00:28:36.617 --> 00:28:39.486
- Im so sorry.
- No problem.

273
00:28:40.087 --> 00:28:44.024
Jin-kyung, its a CCTV tape
from that hotel.

274
00:28:44.324 --> 00:28:46.727
- Of the parking lot?
- Right.

275
00:29:10.817 --> 00:29:15.522
Bite your teeth hard, asshole.
You feel that?

276
00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:21.261
Come on, keep your head up.

277
00:29:22.296 --> 00:29:23.931
Not too high, asshole.

278
00:29:24.932 --> 00:29:27.301
You feel that?
Were not done yet!

279
00:29:27.668 --> 00:29:29.303
Youre pathetic.

280
00:29:29.703 --> 00:29:32.506
Why are you messing around
with a sandbag?

281
00:29:32.806 --> 00:29:34.341
Whatd it do to you?

282
00:29:35.309 --> 00:29:38.645
I have to train constantly
to protect our family.

283
00:29:38.645 --> 00:29:41.682
Prevention is better
than cure.

284
00:29:43.884 --> 00:29:49.122
How about trying harder in bed
if you value the family?

285
00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:51.992
What are you saying?

286
00:29:52.392 --> 00:29:55.596
Producing children is also
helping the family.

287
00:29:55.929 --> 00:29:56.630
What?

288
00:29:56.864 --> 00:29:59.800
Stop nagging me, bitch,
before I make you.

289
00:30:02.035 --> 00:30:03.370
It hurts.

290
00:30:03.537 --> 00:30:06.807
Let go of my arm.
Right now!

291
00:30:07.107 --> 00:30:11.712
Let me jog your memory.

292
00:30:11.979 --> 00:30:16.450
I ruled the high school.
Dont forget that.

293
00:30:16.683 --> 00:30:18.685
Dont push the button.

294
00:30:20.521 --> 00:30:23.323
Mothers looking for you.

295
00:30:24.391 --> 00:30:26.627
This is embarrassing.

296
00:30:27.961 --> 00:30:31.331
- You called them in Seoul?
- Yes.

297
00:30:31.865 --> 00:30:33.333
And?

298
00:30:33.901 --> 00:30:40.741
They tried to hook him up,
but he turned them all down.

299
00:30:41.408 --> 00:30:42.342
What?

300
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:48.382
Go to Seoul and find him a wife
by my birthday next month.

301
00:30:48.682 --> 00:30:49.550
Understood?

302
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.218
Okay, Mom.

303
00:30:51.318 --> 00:30:54.521
By my birthday!

304
00:30:57.991 --> 00:31:02.996
Hello? Young-mi?
Its me, Suk-jae.

305
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:07.267
I bought you a cell phone.
Remember?

306
00:31:07.568 --> 00:31:09.937
One with a thick accent.

307
00:31:11.004 --> 00:31:13.440
Im coming to Seoul today.

308
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.245
Anything you want?

309
00:31:19.146 --> 00:31:21.448
What dung?

310
00:31:22.783 --> 00:31:23.917
Louis VuiDung?

311
00:31:24.751 --> 00:31:27.588
You want me
to buy you dung?

312
00:31:27.855 --> 00:31:28.856
Youre hurting me!

313
00:31:29.857 --> 00:31:33.694
Oh, its a brand name?
No problem.

314
00:31:34.862 --> 00:31:37.464
Ill call you
when Im in town.

315
00:31:38.932 --> 00:31:40.834
Not too hard!

316
00:31:43.036 --> 00:31:47.241
Who on earth would name
their brand Dung?

317
00:31:47.908 --> 00:31:51.278
You never buy me
anything.

318
00:31:51.612 --> 00:31:54.014
Youre not pretty enough.

319
00:31:54.648 --> 00:32:00.821
You buy her Louis Vuitton.
Why not me?

320
00:32:01.421 --> 00:32:05.659
Youre a hooker,
and shes not.

321
00:32:05.792 --> 00:32:09.463
Be grateful that I hire you
once a week!

322
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:13.600
Suk-jae, keep it up,
and Ill tell your wife!

323
00:32:17.104 --> 00:32:22.042
Youre so hot-tempered.
Okay, fine.

324
00:32:22.042 --> 00:32:24.945
Ill buy you dung, too.

325
00:32:25.445 --> 00:32:27.781
- Really?
- Of course.

326
00:32:31.218 --> 00:32:36.056
You hold onto boobs all day.
What are you, a calf?

327
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.458
Were leaving now.

328
00:32:38.458 --> 00:32:41.128
Can I finish
what Ive started?

329
00:32:41.295 --> 00:32:43.197
There are boobs in Seoul, too.

330
00:32:43.197 --> 00:32:45.032
Wheres the fire?

331
00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:48.135
That asshole is too pushy.

332
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:55.142
Well finish this later.

333
00:32:57.845 --> 00:32:58.779
Okay.

334
00:33:04.117 --> 00:33:05.085
Who is it?

335
00:33:07.321 --> 00:33:09.623
Right after I fell asleep!

336
00:33:14.261 --> 00:33:15.229
Hi.

337
00:33:17.331 --> 00:33:18.098
Hi.

338
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:25.072
- Can I come in?
- Sure, but...

339
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.671
Bravo!

340
00:34:02.176 --> 00:34:06.480
Sorry about this morning.
I didnt know youd saved me.

341
00:34:07.748 --> 00:34:12.586
Well... its nothing.

342
00:34:13.453 --> 00:34:15.022
Thanks for saving my life.

343
00:34:17.224 --> 00:34:20.227
No, dont mention it.

344
00:34:22.796 --> 00:34:29.469
I dont even know your name.

345
00:34:30.904 --> 00:34:31.972
You want to?

346
00:34:34.308 --> 00:34:34.975
Yes...

347
00:34:36.844 --> 00:34:38.378
My name is...

348
00:34:41.081 --> 00:34:42.616
My name is...

349
00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.788
Bro.

350
00:34:49.122 --> 00:34:51.992
Was I in your dream, Bro?

351
00:34:55.562 --> 00:34:56.897
Were you dreaming?

352
00:34:57.231 --> 00:34:59.833
- Suk-jae.
- Yeah, its me.

353
00:35:00.601 --> 00:35:02.269
What are you doing here?

354
00:35:02.636 --> 00:35:04.838
Mom sent us.

355
00:35:05.439 --> 00:35:06.573
Why?

356
00:35:06.773 --> 00:35:10.944
We were told to find you a wife
by her birthday.

357
00:35:11.411 --> 00:35:14.515
Otherwise, shes gonna marry you
to any girl she sees.

358
00:35:15.582 --> 00:35:17.885
Shes at it again.

359
00:35:18.418 --> 00:35:20.420
What can we do?

360
00:35:20.587 --> 00:35:25.392
We have to bring back you
and your wife-to-be.

361
00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:30.564
Dont worry.
Ill handle it.

362
00:35:31.298 --> 00:35:34.334
Since youre here,
Why dont we go drinking?

363
00:35:34.902 --> 00:35:36.303
I want to.

364
00:35:38.005 --> 00:35:40.774
But I gotta go buy dung
and plant a tree.

365
00:35:41.041 --> 00:35:42.276
Ill take a rain check.

366
00:35:42.809 --> 00:35:45.445
We should let him rest.
Lets go.

367
00:35:45.779 --> 00:35:48.081
- Go back to bed.
- Sleep tight.

368
00:36:04.064 --> 00:36:05.199
Its not locked.

Stop hitting me.

401
00:39:01.108 --> 00:39:03.443
How could you extort money

- I didnt.
- Shut up!

403
00:39:05.412 --> 00:39:07.681
Where were you thinking?

404
00:39:07.848 --> 00:39:11.185
We were just trying to help
those in need.

405
00:39:11.318 --> 00:39:14.354
Wheres this society going?

406
00:39:14.354 --> 00:39:15.155

00:39:39.046 --> 00:39:43.517
I know things are tough
these days.

411
00:39:43.517 --> 00:39:46.420
But extorting money
from a gangster?

412
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.322
Thats completely crazy.

413
00:39:48.555 --> 00:39:53.627
I told you to get his number.

414
00:39:53.927 --> 00:39:57.064
Not his organization, fool.

415
00:39:58.699 --> 00:40:01.768
- Im sorry, Boss.
- Youre an idiot!

416
00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:09.877
What the fuck goes on
in your damn head?

417
00:40:12.312 --> 00:40:16.917
Suk-jae, What can I do with this head?

418
00:40:18.018 --> 00:40:22.022
You can use it
to balance yourself, asshole.

419
00:40:25.192 --> 00:40:31.131
Thats right.
Nobody can beat this deal.

420
00:40:31.732 --> 00:40:33.867
Hold on a second.

our partnership.

429

430
00:41:10.971 --> 00:41:14.141
- What about name cards?
- Right here.

431
00:41:15.142 --> 00:41:18.512
Why social work suddenly?

432
00:41:18.779 --> 00:41:21.481
Its not our cup of tea.

433
00:41:22.216 --> 00:41:27.221
If were gonna do it,
lets change the name first.

434
00:41:27.754 --> 00:41:30.691
Share Love is so corny.
Isnt it?

435
00:41:30.858 --> 00:41:35.195
Yeah, it sounds like
we are promoting orgies.

436
00:41:35.195 --> 00:41:35.863
Right.

437
00:41:36.797 --> 00:41:38.232
Any ideas?

438
00:41:38.498 --> 00:41:42.436
Its a global age.
Why dont we make it in English?

439
00:41:44.238 --> 00:41:45.472
Anything good in mind?

440
00:41:45.739 --> 00:41:47.374
Of course!

441
00:41:47.708 --> 00:41:51.712
We are introducing
a new business.

442
00:41:51.712 --> 00:41:52.880
So were like a MC.

443
00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.214
Right.

444
00:41:54.748 --> 00:41:57.618
A MC launching a business...

445
00:41:57.618 --> 00:42:00.420
What about MC Business?

446
00:42:03.056 --> 00:42:05.058
You must study English hard.

447
00:42:06.093 --> 00:42:07.494
You go to an academy?

448
00:42:09.463 --> 00:42:12.266
But its too difficult.

449
00:42:12.432 --> 00:42:16.036
Yes, were not good at English.

450
00:42:16.036 --> 00:42:17.204
Korean is better.

451
00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:21.275
Its your problem.
I study hard these days.

452
00:42:27.714 --> 00:42:30.551
Do you know what an
orange is called in English?

453
00:42:30.851 --> 00:42:32.085
Orange?

454
00:42:34.154 --> 00:42:37.057

456
00:42:39.526 --> 00:42:44.231
Orange, orange... Hey, Jon-myun!
You can tell me instead of me.

457
00:42:45.999 --> 00:42:47.334
Jong-myun, do you know it?

458
00:42:47.334 --> 00:42:49.303
How can I know it.

459
00:42:49.536 --> 00:42:52.806
- You dont know me yet?
- Why are you yelling at me? Bitch!

460
00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.176

00:42:57.811 --> 00:42:59.780
So tell me what is it?

462
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:04.384
You all idiots.

00:43:04.451 --> 00:43:08.388
Right, Delmont!
I only remembered Del.

464
00:43:12.025 --> 00:43:14.161
Maybe theres an eraser in my head.

465
00:43:14.161 --> 00:43:15.462
So get it out, fool.

466
00:43:15.462 --> 00:43:17.965

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.135

Youre evading a statement now.

539
00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.896
Youre asking a leading question.

552
00:49:49.489 --> 00:49:51.091
You already sleep with her?

553
00:49:51.758 --> 00:49:54.795
Who knows?
Their love will be matured.

554
00:49:55.195 --> 00:49:58.098
Tell us honestly, bro.

555
00:49:59.399 --> 00:50:01.335
Did you sleep with her?

556
00:50:05.205 --> 00:50:07.107
I cant even hold her hand yet.

557
00:50:07.574 --> 00:50:11.144
What? Even hand? What the hell...?

558
00:50:11.478 --> 00:50:15.549
Why didnt you do anything?

559
00:50:19.586 --> 00:50:22.689
When you meet a girl.
Your rhythm is the most important thing.

560
00:50:22.689 --> 00:50:24.591
Only my rhythm.

561
00:50:32.065 --> 00:50:36.637
I feel heavy.
I did it only in my mind.

562
00:50:37.871 --> 00:50:40.440
Boss, I have...

563
00:50:44.378 --> 00:50:46.346
I have good idea.

564
00:51:02.896 --> 00:51:07.801
The theater is the best
place to kiss a girl, Boss.

565
00:51:08.602 --> 00:51:10.571
If you choose a horror movie,

566
00:51:10.971 --> 00:51:13.607
all you have to do is just sit down.

567
00:51:17.845 --> 00:51:20.581
Shit!

568
00:51:28.755 --> 00:51:34.862
- Dont say anything from now on.
- Yes, boss.

569
00:51:37.731 --> 00:51:40.133
I brought burning shame
on myself.

570
00:51:41.702 --> 00:51:44.171
So why did you believe me, boss.

571
00:52:52.272 --> 00:52:53.340
Whats wrong?

572
00:52:55.242 --> 00:52:58.679
Whats this?
Its inferior crap!

573
00:53:04.351 --> 00:53:06.153
Damn it... In-jae?

574
00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.656
What, now?

575
00:53:10.791 --> 00:53:13.060
Im about to go out.

576
00:53:13.493 --> 00:53:15.462
OK, Im right there.

577
00:53:24.071 --> 00:53:28.375
If you wanna feel her boobs,
a motorcycle is the best.

578
00:53:29.776 --> 00:53:34.915
Because she cannot help
holding you tight.

579
00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:37.744
- Jin-kyung, Hold tight!
- W...wait!

580
00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:10.611
Seok-jae, thank you.

581
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:16.717
Its working, isnt it?

582
00:55:19.152 --> 00:55:23.290
Thats why I said
I'm an expert in erotic love.

583
00:55:27.027 --> 00:55:28.996
Give me another chance.

584
00:55:31.598 --> 00:55:33.330
How about going to a theme park?

585
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.102
Riding the rollercoaster...

586
00:55:35.102 --> 00:55:37.538
- Jong-myun.
- Isnt it good?

587
00:55:37.538 --> 00:55:39.640
- Shut up.
- Yes, boss.

588
00:56:36.763 --> 00:56:37.831
Jong-myun?

589
00:56:55.148 --> 00:56:58.886
In-jae?
Maybe youre busy, now.

590
00:57:00.587 --> 00:57:02.389
Today was so great.

591
00:57:03.156 --> 00:57:09.997
Actually I have something to tell you.

592
00:57:12.232 --> 00:57:14.401
I cant hide it anymore.

593
00:57:21.041 --> 00:57:24.011
Im a prosecutor in charge
of crimes of violence.

594
00:57:29.249 --> 00:57:30.717
It doesnt match me.

595
00:57:36.089 --> 00:57:39.293
- Jong-myun.
- Yes, boss.

596
00:57:41.261 --> 00:57:43.664
- Give me a cigarette.
- What?

597
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.270
Please, kill me.

598
00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:30.744
Keep that idiot in the house, please.

599
00:58:31.445 --> 00:58:33.213
Hes useless to your life.

600
00:58:35.983 --> 00:58:39.516
This son of a bitch made my brother
take up smoking.

601
00:58:39.887 --> 00:58:42.456
Hey, give me an axe quickly.

602
00:58:45.559 --> 00:58:48.595
Mother Fucker, you wanted to beat us?

603
00:58:48.795 --> 00:58:51.698
Did you think were a kind of drum?

604
00:58:51.865 --> 00:58:57.204
Anyway I want to investigate
your organization.

605
00:58:57.504 --> 00:58:58.872
Hold his leg!

606
00:59:00.107 --> 00:59:04.344
Stop it.
You dont need to do that.

607
00:59:04.645 --> 00:59:07.848
Bro, this sucker turned on our followers.

608
00:59:07.848 --> 00:59:13.453
You have to set a good example.
So lets fuck him up!

609
00:59:13.453 --> 00:59:18.192
He has no charge.
His boss made him to do that.

610
00:59:18.725 --> 00:59:22.796
- I feel so heavy!
- Im gonna go nuts!

611
00:59:23.096 --> 00:59:24.965
Its your lucky day.

612
00:59:28.869 --> 00:59:30.871
Go and buy a lottery ticket.

613
00:59:32.873 --> 00:59:37.077
- Whats your name?
- Kwang-ki.

614
00:59:38.612 --> 00:59:46.854
- Kwang-ki? Is your family name Kwang?
- Jo Kwang-ki.

615
00:59:49.590 --> 01:00:00.367
I know, I know Jo Kwang-ki.
Go and tell your boss.

616
01:00:01.235 --> 01:00:04.738
If he leaves me alone,
Ill leave him alone, too.

617
01:00:07.407 --> 01:00:08.809
What did he say?

618
01:00:09.176 --> 01:00:14.114
If I leave him alone, hell leave me alone, too?

619
01:00:14.448 --> 01:00:17.017
- Yes.
- You scumbag!

620
01:00:19.152 --> 01:00:23.724
Did I tell you to go and
be their messenger?

621
01:00:23.757 --> 01:00:24.491
No.

622
01:00:24.925 --> 01:00:28.996
Dont answer back, fucker.

623
01:00:29.363 --> 01:00:32.399
So now you stand on their side?

624
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:45.112
If you make a mistake one more time.

625
01:00:45.779 --> 01:00:49.049
Ill take off your hand, OK?

626
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.648
I captured the movement of the Axe.

627
01:00:51.618 --> 01:00:55.189
Last night Yun Do-sick failed

628
01:00:55.189 --> 01:00:57.324
to get the Aquus night club.

629
01:00:57.991 --> 01:00:59.259
The Aquus night club?

630
01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.729
Yes, theres white tiger
who coming up from Yeo-soo.

631
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:04.531
That night club belongs to them.

632
01:01:04.798 --> 01:01:07.301
Maybe they wanna enter into Seoul.

633
01:01:07.501 --> 01:01:11.805
White tiger? Can you make me
a genealogy of the White tigers?

634
01:01:11.805 --> 01:01:12.573
Sure.

635
01:01:12.873 --> 01:01:15.142
Why they didnt stay at Yeo-soo

636
01:01:15.142 --> 01:01:16.944
and they came up to Seoul for what?

637
01:01:17.177 --> 01:01:20.214
Well arrest both Axe and
White tiger this time.

638
01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:25.319
Dont hesitate, youve got to get information

639
01:01:25.319 --> 01:01:28.689
about them as quickly as you can.

640
01:01:29.189 --> 01:01:30.490
Our meetings over.

641
01:01:33.961 --> 01:01:34.995
How about cold soup?

642
01:01:35.495 --> 01:01:37.631
I used to skip over breakfast.

643
01:01:37.865 --> 01:01:39.967
Well, how about dinner?

644
01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.971
I know a great restaurant where they
cook chickens fed with lacquer plants.

645
01:01:44.238 --> 01:01:46.406
Im allergic to lacquer.

646
01:01:46.707 --> 01:01:48.442
So how about spicy chicken?

647
01:01:48.542 --> 01:01:50.811
Theres my favorite house in Jong-ro 3rd.

648
01:01:50.878 --> 01:01:53.680
I have a reservation to eat Chicken soup.

649
01:02:07.327 --> 01:02:08.195
You were surprised.

650
01:02:11.131 --> 01:02:12.132
No, no.

651
01:02:12.933 --> 01:02:16.170
People look on female prosecutor
with a jaundiced eye.

652
01:02:20.374 --> 01:02:23.443
Why?

653
01:02:24.244 --> 01:02:29.616
They think we are spiteful.
Well, Im little tough actually.

654
01:02:31.351 --> 01:02:36.023
Of course they have to be tough.

655
01:02:36.924 --> 01:02:42.396
I have no secret now.
How about you?

656
01:03:47.561 --> 01:03:48.495
Mr. Bong?

657
01:04:28.769 --> 01:04:31.638
Markes de Riscal...

658
01:04:32.239 --> 01:04:35.209
its a perfect wine for
romantic guy like me.

659
01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:36.810
What do you think?

660
01:04:37.444 --> 01:04:41.582
Its good.
Anyway, you have something to tell me?

661
01:04:42.416 --> 01:04:44.117
Ah, that is...

662
01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:46.720
Why do you hesitate?

663
01:04:55.028 --> 01:04:56.663
Heres your dessert, sir.

664
01:05:10.677 --> 01:05:14.681
- Jin-kyung, will you marry me?
- What?

665
01:05:15.282 --> 01:05:18.185
Ive been watching you for 3 years.

666
01:05:19.052 --> 01:05:20.954
I was thinking a lot.

667
01:05:21.522 --> 01:05:23.490
You deserve to get me.

668
01:05:24.591 --> 01:05:28.228
Well, wait a second.

669
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:30.831
Where is the rest room?

670
01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.002
Follow me, please.

671
01:05:41.108 --> 01:05:42.109
What?

672
01:05:49.016 --> 01:05:53.187
Is he a fool? I never go out with him.

673
01:06:00.794 --> 01:06:06.667
In-jae? I have dinner with a colleague.

674
01:06:08.402 --> 01:06:10.938
In-jae, Are you drunk?

675
01:06:12.639 --> 01:06:15.475
What, youre going to come here?

676
01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:25.652
I always miss you so much.

677
01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:31.925
But youre not as close
as you in my mind.

678
01:06:32.526 --> 01:06:37.431
Looking at worn out picture of you.

679
01:06:37.431 --> 01:06:41.001
Excuse me, did you see the guy?

680
01:06:41.902 --> 01:06:44.338
- Maybe hes gone because hes in shock.
- What?

681
01:06:45.706 --> 01:06:49.309
You refused his proposal.

682
01:06:51.645 --> 01:06:56.083
I always miss you.
Where did you go?

683
01:06:57.951 --> 01:07:08.262
I see you in my tear.
Come back to me, please.

684
01:07:08.862 --> 01:07:10.026
What the...

685
01:07:10.631 --> 01:07:16.370
Come back to me.
Please come back to me.

686
01:07:16.937 --> 01:07:21.275
Im always thinking of you.

687
01:07:23.277 --> 01:07:37.457
You cant avoid my ardent love.
Please come back to me.

688
01:08:04.384 --> 01:08:14.761
I always miss you.
Where did you go?

689
01:08:16.997 --> 01:08:27.074
I see you in my tear.
Come back to me, please.

690
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.976
You had one too many.

691
01:08:29.076 --> 01:08:33.547
No, I didnt drink too much.

692
01:08:36.016 --> 01:08:37.885
Can we talk?

693
01:08:38.952 --> 01:08:41.088
OK, lets get out of here.

694
01:08:42.256 --> 01:08:57.671
You cant avoid my ardent love.
Please come back to me.

695
01:09:05.145 --> 01:09:06.346
Whats wrong with you?

696
01:09:07.147 --> 01:09:08.849
Its the first time I see you drunk.

697
01:09:10.384 --> 01:09:15.622
Actually, today is my birthday so...

698
01:09:16.223 --> 01:09:18.959
What? Why didnt you tell me?

699
01:09:20.394 --> 01:09:24.631
I usually drink alone.

700
01:09:27.467 --> 01:09:28.335
Wait here.

701
01:09:35.609 --> 01:09:38.545
Happy birthday.

702
01:09:44.651 --> 01:09:50.958
Theres something you
have to know about me.

703
01:09:54.928 --> 01:09:58.332
- Actually, Im...
- III get it as time goes by.

704
01:09:58.332 --> 01:10:00.234
No, its too late...

705
01:10:00.234 --> 01:10:06.540
What you did and Who you met
its not important for me.

706
01:10:06.707 --> 01:10:09.943
I really dont care.

707
01:10:10.811 --> 01:10:12.746
if you can stay with me from now.

708
01:10:17.084 --> 01:10:22.122
Im relieved at what you said.

709
01:10:23.857 --> 01:10:27.928
There was a dark age in my life.

710
01:10:28.862 --> 01:10:33.800
I understand.
But it makes you like you.

711
01:10:34.601 --> 01:10:38.038
Its impossible you were a gangster.

712
01:10:39.873 --> 01:10:41.775
So you are enough for me.

713
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:44.378
Happy birthday.

714
01:10:56.557 --> 01:11:00.093
- Youre still working?
- Yes, what is it?

715
01:11:00.527 --> 01:11:01.662
White tigers genealogy.

716
01:11:02.663 --> 01:11:05.532
Give me.
Thats OK, give me.

717
01:11:12.105 --> 01:11:13.774
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

718
01:11:13.774 --> 01:11:14.775
Hello.

719
01:11:16.143 --> 01:11:18.111
Here you are.

720
01:11:18.879 --> 01:11:20.948
I was sorry yesterday.

721
01:11:21.515 --> 01:11:23.083
But I...

722
01:11:28.288 --> 01:11:29.656
White tiger

723
01:11:44.037 --> 01:11:48.775
What the hell is it?
Youre kidding me?

724
01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:51.712
I dont have time to that.

725
01:11:51.745 --> 01:11:53.213
You can believe what you see.

726
01:11:53.447 --> 01:11:56.183
Jang In-jae is a fucking gangster.

727
01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:59.219
That oily, hooknose fucking gangster.

728
01:11:59.853 --> 01:12:02.823
Its impossible.

729
01:12:03.524 --> 01:12:05.792
I cannot believe this picture.

730
01:12:05.926 --> 01:12:08.362
Its a different person
with the same name.

731
01:12:09.897 --> 01:12:15.502
Its ridiculous.
I know him very well.

732
01:12:17.237 --> 01:12:20.741
Jin-kyung, are you an idiot?

733
01:12:21.575 --> 01:12:24.044
That motherfucker is lying to you.

734
01:12:24.978 --> 01:12:28.215
No, he saved my life

735
01:12:28.282 --> 01:12:30.884
when I met Axes boss, Do-sick.

736
01:12:31.451 --> 01:12:33.253
He saved me.

737
01:12:34.188 --> 01:12:36.256
Anyway never meet him again.

738
01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:40.894
He certainly has a plot in mind.

739
01:12:55.909 --> 01:12:57.778
Take care, boss.

740
01:12:58.812 --> 01:13:00.147
Take care.

741
01:13:01.648 --> 01:13:04.084
- Take care, boss.
- OK.

742
01:13:04.785 --> 01:13:07.721
Do not loaf on the job in the office!

743
01:13:31.879 --> 01:13:33.647
- Jin-kyung.
- In-jae.

744
01:13:35.349 --> 01:13:37.184
You didnt answer the phone all day.

745
01:13:39.887 --> 01:13:41.021
Whats wrong?

746
01:13:41.655 --> 01:13:48.228
Nothing, just because I was so busy today.

747
01:13:48.328 --> 01:13:51.064
Why didnt you call me?
I worried.

748
01:13:51.298 --> 01:13:51.899
Im sorry.

749
01:13:52.833 --> 01:13:53.800
Did you eat dinner?

750
01:13:58.238 --> 01:14:01.241
You look so pale, are you OK?

751
01:14:03.043 --> 01:14:04.878
Im just so tired.

752
01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:07.281
You wanna eat something?

753
01:14:08.415 --> 01:14:11.251
No, its better take a rest.

754
01:14:13.887 --> 01:14:18.725
I see, OK...

755
01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.629
Something to tell me?

756
01:14:25.966 --> 01:14:33.140
Well... My mothers birthday is
the day after tomorrow.

757
01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:39.780
Really? Congratulations.
I have to go.

758
01:14:54.194 --> 01:14:57.798
You washed yourself too hard.

759
01:14:58.098 --> 01:14:59.299
Your tattoo must be erased.

760
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.769
For moms birthday party.

761
01:15:05.172 --> 01:15:07.241
- Seok-jae.
- Yes, bro.

762
01:15:08.342 --> 01:15:09.710
Do you like that?

763
01:15:14.915 --> 01:15:19.620
I mean family business, gangster.

764
01:15:20.754 --> 01:15:24.791
Hey, who wants to be a gangster?

765
01:15:25.225 --> 01:15:29.363
But its our family business and my job.

766
01:15:29.863 --> 01:15:32.666
Why? You dont like it?

767
01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:40.536
No, I dont like it.
I dont wanna do this anymore.

768
01:15:40.774 --> 01:15:45.279
You cannot say that.
Youre our leader.

769
01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.515
Why do you suddenly say that?

770
01:15:49.349 --> 01:15:51.785
Its your girlfriend?

771
01:15:53.253 --> 01:15:56.323
She doesnt like you
because youre a gangster?

772
01:15:57.758 --> 01:16:00.894
Do you remember fathers word?

773
01:16:01.662 --> 01:16:04.364
Father said that a woman is
just an obstacle to a man.

774
01:16:05.265 --> 01:16:10.637
A good girl is someone who waits
for man... like furniture.

775
01:16:11.171 --> 01:16:13.607
Its so difficult

776
01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:17.477
to meet a good girl.

777
01:16:17.945 --> 01:16:20.480
But youre the boss whos leading us.

778
01:16:21.515 --> 01:16:23.450

It was contrary to our expectation.

782
01:16:40.834 --> 01:16:41.702

Its not a birthday party for baby.

805
01:18:58.839 --> 01:19:03.143
You think my mom is a one year baby?

806
01:19:04.044 --> 01:19:05.679

807
01:19:06.647 --> 01:19:09.183

819
01:20:04.805 --> 01:20:08.809

820
01:20:09.076 --> 01:20:11.378
Youre so cute today!

821
01:20:12.279 --> 01:20:19.219
What a beautiful girl.
Thank you for coming.

822
01:20:19.319 --> 01:20:22.489
It took such a long time
to come here from Seoul.

823
01:20:23.156 --> 01:20:29.429
Hello, Im second brother
Jang Seok-jae.

824
01:20:29.496 --> 01:20:31.064
How are you?

825
01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:34.601
You got fur on the tongue?
What happened to your way of talking?

826
01:20:35.068 --> 01:20:37.905
What are you doing?
Come in with her.

827
01:20:37.971 --> 01:20:39.039
Yes, mom.

828
01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:42.075
Lets go, hurry.

829
01:20:49.183 --> 01:20:54.288
Hey, who is that bitch?
Why does she take that bitch?

830
01:20:54.421 --> 01:20:58.854
Watch your mouth.
Shes a fianc of In-jae.

831
01:20:59.126 --> 01:21:01.295
Its so weird.

832
01:21:01.728 --> 01:21:05.299
Shes very similar with Jin-sook.

833
01:21:05.666 --> 01:21:08.836
Jin-sook? Youre right.

834
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:12.773
He surely has his own style.

835
01:21:13.006 --> 01:21:16.577
He likes the girl who looks
like anchovys head.

836
01:21:20.714 --> 01:21:24.952
We already broke up.

837
01:21:26.019 --> 01:21:30.324
So dont cry when youre sad.

838
01:21:31.325 --> 01:21:40.896
Do not have lingering affection.
Its too late.

839
01:21:41.835 --> 01:21:46.673
And hide your tear, save your tear.

840
01:21:47.274 --> 01:21:50.677
Loneliness is more painful than parting.

841
01:21:50.677 --> 01:21:54.381
Oh, youre so sexy.

842
01:21:57.551 --> 01:22:01.588
Just cry when you miss her.

843
01:22:03.056 --> 01:22:05.726

01:22:10.197 --> 01:22:11.431
Hi, Mrs. Hong.

01:22:32.286 --> 01:22:36.456
Stop it, please.
I am ashamed.

01:22:37.157 --> 01:22:39.960
This is Park, from Kwang-ju.

853

Nice to see you.

854
01:22:40.961 --> 01:22:45.866
Every pimp in Kwang-ju knows his name.

855
01:22:45.933 --> 01:22:50.871
He goes into prison so often
that you can see his face in TV.

856
01:22:51.205 --> 01:22:54.908
Be a good person, bitch.

857
01:22:55.576 --> 01:23:00.013
This is Yosimura Sato Sang, from Japan.

858
01:23:09.089 --> 01:23:11.291
What does she do?

859
01:23:11.358 --> 01:23:15.162
Shes a public official.

860
01:23:15.495 --> 01:23:18.999
Do you know how hard it is
being a public official?

861
01:23:19.199 --> 01:23:20.100
- I know.
- Official?

862
01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.802

01:23:25.439 --> 01:23:26.874
At the Public Prosecutors Office.

865
01:23:30.744 --> 01:23:32.045
Public Prosecutors Office?

866
01:23:33.814 --> 01:23:37.718
Its such a hard work place for a woman.

867
01:23:38.318 --> 01:23:39.786
So whats your duty?

868
01:23:40.053 --> 01:23:41.255
Im prosecutor of violent crimes.

869
01:23:41.855 --> 01:23:44.558

I throw gangsters into prison.

872
01:23:58.839 --> 01:24:00.274
Fuck.

873
01:24:04.444 --> 01:24:06.280

874
01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.046
- Im sorry but I have to go now.
- OK, ok, you can go.

875
01:24:11.852 --> 01:24:14.555
Sorry but my mother is sick.

876
01:24:14.555 --> 01:24:17.457

877
01:24:18.091 --> 01:24:20.460

Hurry up, go.

880
01:24:27.534 --> 01:24:31.705
I was born at bust day.

881
01:24:45.419 --> 01:24:50.891
So you are...
Youre the honorable prosecutor Kim...

882
01:24:51.058 --> 01:24:53.227
Please drop the honorific title.

883
01:24:53.227 --> 01:24:55.696
No, how can I do that.

884
01:24:55.863 --> 01:24:58.432
Youre a prosecutor.

885
01:25:00.234 --> 01:25:02.736
Can I... do that?

886
01:25:04.238 --> 01:25:05.772
Of course you can.

887
01:25:07.174 --> 01:25:10.010
Excuse me, but that gun is registered?

888
01:25:12.646 --> 01:25:16.250
Sure.
I always follow the law.

889
01:25:16.383 --> 01:25:17.150
Thats good.

890
01:25:17.417 --> 01:25:19.820
Its the voluntary reporting period
for illegal weapons.

891
01:25:21.221 --> 01:25:28.295
Those are toy guns!
You can try it immediately if you want.

892
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:32.399
That knife looks very sharp.

893
01:25:34.168 --> 01:25:39.540
Its used to make Sasimi.
Yeo-soo is famous of fish.

894
01:25:40.007 --> 01:25:44.011
But some people use that knife on human.

895
01:25:44.444 --> 01:25:48.282
What? Its horrible.

896
01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:53.854
Im an ordinary house wife,
so I only see that in movies.

897
01:25:55.622 --> 01:25:57.424
Boss, a terrible accident!

898
01:25:57.558 --> 01:26:00.460
Im busy now, talk you later.

899
01:26:00.727 --> 01:26:03.363
Popeye family attacked the Amazon!

900
01:26:03.363 --> 01:26:05.399
What? That fucker attacked us?

901
01:26:06.633 --> 01:26:11.238
He visited us after a long time.
What happened?

902
01:26:11.238 --> 01:26:14.708
Maybe he came to here to meet Olive.

903
01:26:14.908 --> 01:26:16.877
Talk to him has a good time.

904
01:26:17.144 --> 01:26:21.081
Why didnt you respond to
that motherfuckers attack!

905
01:26:21.081 --> 01:26:24.117
Youre a foul-mouthed fucker.

906
01:26:24.284 --> 01:26:26.153
Go and watch your business.

907
01:26:26.153 --> 01:26:28.922
Dont quarrel with each other.

908
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:32.659
Get along together, do some patty-cake.

909
01:26:34.962 --> 01:26:39.700
- Its so strange.
- What?

910
01:26:40.334 --> 01:26:45.472
Youre very similar to my old friend.

911
01:26:45.639 --> 01:26:47.975
Really? What does she do?

912
01:26:48.175 --> 01:26:52.713
She had a serious relationship with In-jae.

913
01:26:53.013 --> 01:26:54.915
They almost got engaged...huh!

914
01:26:55.449 --> 01:26:57.317
Really?

915
01:26:57.885 --> 01:27:02.556
What am I saying?
Sorry, Im crazy.

916
01:27:03.223 --> 01:27:07.794
Ill keep a secret, please tell me.

917
01:27:09.763 --> 01:27:10.831
OK.

918
01:27:14.168 --> 01:27:19.072
I met Jin-sook more than
ten years before.

919
01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:23.577
Both of us were very famous in here.

920
01:27:23.844 --> 01:27:29.049
She and I ran a neck-and-neck race

921
01:27:30.184 --> 01:27:33.387
when we met.

922
01:28:16.463 --> 01:28:21.235
After that, I could have
been washed up

923
01:28:21.535 --> 01:28:25.539
but she didnt throw me away.

924
01:28:26.507 --> 01:28:30.844
She and In-jae are most
famous couple here.

925
01:28:31.378 --> 01:28:33.347
Its combination of male and female boss.

926
01:28:33.413 --> 01:28:35.415
Nobody could touch them.

927
01:28:36.650 --> 01:28:40.387
But someday...

928
01:28:42.623 --> 01:28:45.926
Mugunghaw flower bloom!
You so cute.

929
01:28:46.226 --> 01:28:48.395
Mugunghaw flower bloom!

930
01:28:49.696 --> 01:28:51.598
Mugunghaw flower bloom!

931
01:28:52.533 --> 01:28:54.434
Mugunghaw flower bloom!

932
01:28:59.106 --> 01:29:00.841
I wish it never happened...

933
01:29:08.815 --> 01:29:14.588
Why do these damn tears come out.

934
01:29:15.689 --> 01:29:19.660
Sorry about it.
I miss her so much.

935
01:29:21.895 --> 01:29:23.730
Good bye, mother.

936
01:29:23.997 --> 01:29:28.001
OK, take care.
And you call me later.

937
01:29:28.068 --> 01:29:28.802
Yes, mom.

938
01:29:30.204 --> 01:29:33.040
- Bye.
- Be careful.

939
01:29:39.046 --> 01:29:42.216
Is it OK? Shes a prosecutor.

940
01:29:42.482 --> 01:29:45.452
It does not matter.
Its a family honor.

941
01:29:45.719 --> 01:29:48.789
She can be the enemys in-Iaw.

942
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:52.226
She doesnt know about us yet?

943
01:29:52.993 --> 01:29:56.263
I dont know.
If she knows, it will be over.

944
01:29:56.496 --> 01:30:00.701
Are you fool?
She saw all scumbags in the party hall.

945
01:30:01.134 --> 01:30:02.870
- Lets go inside.
- Yes, mother.

946
01:30:03.036 --> 01:30:04.238
You go first.

947
01:30:06.006 --> 01:30:07.875
Do you think Im a dupe?

948
01:30:09.142 --> 01:30:12.279
You think I get deceived forever?

949
01:30:16.183 --> 01:30:21.288
You get blackmailed from others
and help needy neighbors?

950
01:30:24.091 --> 01:30:25.058
Im sorry.

951
01:30:26.326 --> 01:30:30.797
Did you sell the nightclub so the profit
could go to your organization?

952
01:30:31.465 --> 01:30:33.734
Im not a genius

953
01:30:35.469 --> 01:30:40.073
but I know what I have to do for.

954
01:30:45.546 --> 01:30:48.015
A prosecutor cant fall in love
with a gangster.

955
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:54.288
So Ill have to change.

956
01:30:54.555 --> 01:30:58.091
How can I believe what you said?

957
01:30:59.526 --> 01:31:03.797
I love you so much.

958
01:31:06.767 --> 01:31:09.036
If I do gangsters job one more time,

959
01:31:11.038 --> 01:31:15.742
You can put handcuffs on me.

960
01:31:40.467 --> 01:31:42.236
Damn it.

961
01:31:42.603 --> 01:31:45.806
How are you...
What are you doing?

962
01:31:52.279 --> 01:31:55.816
What are you doing now?
You cannot do this.

963
01:31:55.916 --> 01:31:56.817
Kyung-jae!

964
01:31:56.984 --> 01:32:01.021
Whats that? Tell me.
Do you know what you did?

965
01:32:01.522 --> 01:32:04.491
Our father achieved all for us.

966
01:32:05.025 --> 01:32:07.327
How dare you destroy them all?

967
01:32:07.961 --> 01:32:10.764
You sold the night club and everything.

968
01:32:10.764 --> 01:32:12.466
Fucking social work organization!

969
01:32:15.903 --> 01:32:17.532
So how can we live from right now?

970
01:32:18.505 --> 01:32:21.475
We are on the verge of starvation.

971
01:32:21.542 --> 01:32:22.543
What the hell is

972
01:32:22.543 --> 01:32:23.610
social work?

973
01:32:24.611 --> 01:32:27.514
Youre a gangster so act like a gangster.

974
01:32:27.881 --> 01:32:31.685
Im not a gangster anymore.

975
01:32:32.653 --> 01:32:35.255
What? Youre not a gangster?

976
01:32:36.423 --> 01:32:39.159
Are you crazy now?

977
01:32:39.726 --> 01:32:43.197
Whole family is made of gangsters,
why not you?

978
01:32:43.564 --> 01:32:47.668
You throw the entire family away
for that bitch?

979
01:33:05.719 --> 01:33:09.223
This tiger is not a tiger anymore.

980
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:14.094
Ill erase this and erase you.

981
01:33:26.406 --> 01:33:30.377
- What! What is this?
- What?

982
01:33:32.746 --> 01:33:37.084
Im your brother too!
You dont know it?

983
01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:38.452
So what?

984
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:49.596
Im always an outcast... Damn it.

985
01:33:52.366 --> 01:33:56.069
What did you say to In-jae?

986
01:33:58.405 --> 01:34:02.576
Shit, I said Ill not betray
family for woman.

987
01:34:04.044 --> 01:34:10.551
Dont make me mad, Ill kill you all!

988
01:34:10.717 --> 01:34:15.422
Hes also painful.
Try to understand him.

989
01:34:15.422 --> 01:34:20.727
Damn it, youre on his side.
Go to him!

990
01:34:20.894 --> 01:34:25.799
Ill be a lonely gangster
in the wasteland.

991
01:34:28.502 --> 01:34:30.070
Hey, fucker! Kyung-jae!

992
01:34:34.408 --> 01:34:36.543
Im neutral.

993
01:34:52.559 --> 01:34:56.296
Boss, were in big trouble.

994
01:34:56.463 --> 01:34:58.866
Fucking Axes kidnapped your brothers.

995
01:35:35.102 --> 01:35:36.503
Are you Jang In-jae?

996
01:35:37.604 --> 01:35:40.073
What bring you here?

997
01:35:40.908 --> 01:35:43.544
I said lets not fight each other.

998
01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:48.081
Only you said, Im not.
I didnt agree with you.

999
01:36:35.863 --> 01:36:38.832
Boss!

1000
01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:41.335
Bro, bro.

1001
01:36:45.272 --> 01:36:46.406
You guys OK?

1002
01:36:48.509 --> 01:36:50.444
We came here as soon as possible

1003
01:36:50.577 --> 01:36:52.846
because youre kidnapped by Axes.

1004
01:36:53.847 --> 01:36:56.783
They indulge in petty wiles.

1005
01:36:57.951 --> 01:36:59.920
Ill kill you all tonight.

1006
01:37:45.933 --> 01:37:47.000
Its my job...

1007
01:38:02.549 --> 01:38:06.019
You have the right to remain silent

1008
01:38:07.321 --> 01:38:09.590
and refuse to answer questions.

1009
01:38:15.295 --> 01:38:16.330
Hey, Jin-kyung!

1010
01:38:17.564 --> 01:38:21.034
Why did you hand in your resignation?

1011
01:38:21.602 --> 01:38:23.971
Its not your fault! Youre innocent!

1012
01:38:41.188 --> 01:38:44.458
- You want?
- I quit.

1013
01:38:47.494 --> 01:38:49.963
OK, have a long life.

1014
01:38:52.599 --> 01:38:57.471
Just be careful that you
dont get stabbed.

1015
01:38:58.872 --> 01:39:02.442
Anyway why did you fight
with a small fry?

1016
01:39:04.344 --> 01:39:08.215
What a great social worker.

1017
01:39:09.283 --> 01:39:12.152
Hey, look at me and talk.

1018
01:39:12.653 --> 01:39:14.655
Who is the real boss of
your organization?

1019
01:39:15.689 --> 01:39:17.024
Its your mother, right?

1020
01:39:19.126 --> 01:39:22.729
Its my organization.

1021
01:39:24.298 --> 01:39:26.767
My mom is an old lady,
what can she do?

1022
01:39:27.901 --> 01:39:33.974
And my brothers just own
little shop which I gave.

1023
01:39:34.408 --> 01:39:38.478
You take all blame? Im touched.

1024
01:39:39.279 --> 01:39:40.848
That is a gangsters oath?

1025
01:39:41.181 --> 01:39:43.217
Not an oath, its the truth.

1026
01:39:44.384 --> 01:39:49.289
So release my brothers
and put me in prison.

1027
01:39:53.827 --> 01:39:55.362
Do you dare to patronize me?

1028
01:40:09.276 --> 01:40:11.078
Jin-kyung, long time no see.

1029
01:40:12.646 --> 01:40:13.814
How are you?

1030
01:40:14.014 --> 01:40:15.415
Are you OK?

1031
01:40:16.884 --> 01:40:22.189
Yes, Im sorry.

1032
01:40:22.556 --> 01:40:24.925
Why you say that?

1033
01:40:25.492 --> 01:40:28.629
Its totally not your fault.

1034
01:40:29.096 --> 01:40:30.564
Dont care.

1035
01:40:31.665 --> 01:40:33.800
What bring you here?

1036
01:40:34.134 --> 01:40:40.073
I received a letter before.
I want give it to you.

1037
01:40:50.284 --> 01:40:54.048
You look so tired, go inside.

1038
01:41:03.964 --> 01:41:07.734
Mom, do you like Jin-kyung?

1039
01:41:09.036 --> 01:41:12.940
I wanna spend my life with her.

1040
01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:15.409
Shes a very good person.

1041
01:41:17.244 --> 01:41:23.517
Mom, if I get marry her

1042
01:41:24.618 --> 01:41:26.820
I cannot be a gangster anymore.

1043
01:41:27.087 --> 01:41:31.992
A gangster cannot be
a prosecutors husband.

1044
01:41:36.330 --> 01:41:41.134
Actually I started a social
work organization recently.

1045
01:41:41.702 --> 01:41:46.473
So I sold some stores
without your permission.

1046
01:41:49.843 --> 01:41:55.082
Im sorry I didnt tell you before.

1047
01:41:56.683 --> 01:42:01.421
But how about well be good people

1048
01:42:02.789 --> 01:42:04.424
from now on?

1049
01:42:05.559 --> 01:42:07.761
- Mother.
- Yes.

1050
01:42:08.662 --> 01:42:09.897
Heres water.

1051
01:42:13.867 --> 01:42:16.537
Hey, can you put poultice on my back?

1052
01:42:16.937 --> 01:42:21.375
I feel sharp pains all over my body.

1053
01:42:21.775 --> 01:42:24.011
Its so painful.

1054
01:42:24.044 --> 01:42:24.845
OK.

1055
01:42:27.314 --> 01:42:28.949
This part twinges.

1056
01:42:29.449 --> 01:42:36.423
Mother, you suffer from ennui.
Is there anything you wanted to do?

1057
01:42:37.491 --> 01:42:40.627
Tell me if you wanna go somewhere.

1058
01:42:44.464 --> 01:42:47.835
I really wanted to

1059
01:42:48.468 --> 01:42:51.772
go to a public bathhouse.

1060
01:42:53.173 --> 01:42:58.979
But I couldnt go there with all
my tattoos for forty years.

1061
01:43:01.081 --> 01:43:02.015
Mother...

1062
01:43:03.884 --> 01:43:09.756
I made my children into gangsters.

1063
01:43:11.925 --> 01:43:19.433
It was all my fault.
I shouldnt have done that.

1064
01:43:53.367 --> 01:43:54.701
All rise!

1065
01:44:01.909 --> 01:44:04.845
Mother, wheres our attorney?

1066
01:44:04.845 --> 01:44:06.079
Shut up.

1067
01:44:07.381 --> 01:44:08.682
Whats going on?

1068
01:44:09.016 --> 01:44:09.783
Sit down.

1069
01:44:16.089 --> 01:44:18.091
Attorney is not present yet?

1070
01:45:02.402 --> 01:45:04.371
Im sorry Im late.

1071
01:45:11.678 --> 01:45:15.048
Case number 2005 1325

1072
01:45:15.716 --> 01:45:18.619
The trial is now in session.

01:45:18.852 --> 01:45:22.723
About the matter of violence
for Jang In-jae.

1074
01:45:24.725 --> 01:45:28.028
The accused used violence
against Yun Do-sick and 28

1075
01:45:28.095 --> 01:45:32.332
on the night of the 23rd of June, right?

1076
01:45:33.834 --> 01:45:34.501
Yes.

1077
01:45:35.402 --> 01:45:40.140
The accused also used
violence against Jo Kwang-ki

1078
01:45:40.407 --> 01:45:44.411
at Aquus night club

Yes.

1080
01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:50.450
You ordered it all directly, right?

1081
01:45:50.551 --> 01:45:53.453
No, it was me!
I ordered all of it!

1082
01:45:53.987 --> 01:45:57.090
Its not true, it was me!

1083
01:45:57.424 --> 01:46:00.527
No, no, listen to me, please.
It was me!

1084
01:46:01.428 --> 01:46:04.765
Keep quiet or Ill order
you out of the room.

1085
01:46:09.403 --> 01:46:12.239
The accused knows
about Sharing Love?

1086
01:46:14.775 --> 01:46:15.475
Yes.

1087
01:46:16.443 --> 01:46:19.079
Can you explain what it is?

1088
01:46:20.881 --> 01:46:23.050
Its a social work organization.

1089
01:46:24.084 --> 01:46:26.720
Whats your position in Sharing Love?

1090
01:46:29.623 --> 01:46:30.858
Im a representative.

1091
01:46:32.993 --> 01:46:35.362
Sharing Love is social organization

1092
01:46:35.429 --> 01:46:38.165
which is founded at 1996.

1093
01:46:39.399 --> 01:46:40.200
After managing

1094
01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.502
the Sharing Love organization,

1095
01:46:41.835 --> 01:46:47.975
he has changed it from a small
poor community club

1096
01:46:48.342 --> 01:46:50.444
into a large community
service organization.

1097
01:46:57.718 --> 01:47:01.555
This is the contribution data of

1098
01:47:01.688 --> 01:47:04.324
the accused Jan In-jaes company.

1099
01:47:05.526 --> 01:47:08.228
Objection! The accused used

1100
01:47:08.228 --> 01:47:12.566
Sharing Love as a front
for criminal enterprise.

1101
01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:17.271
Can you explain what it is?

1102
01:47:17.271 --> 01:47:21.175
It is because he wanted to make a

1103
01:47:21.175 --> 01:47:24.611
favorable impression on his
attorney Kim Jin-kyung.

1104
01:47:25.846 --> 01:47:32.085
Theyve been going out
each other for 3 months.

1105
01:47:32.686 --> 01:47:34.588
So I insist that she has

1106
01:47:35.022 --> 01:47:38.358
no right to defend this case.

1107
01:47:38.892 --> 01:47:40.027
Havent you?

1108
01:47:48.869 --> 01:47:51.939
I have something to tell you.

1109
01:47:52.606 --> 01:47:53.707
Who are you?

1110
01:47:54.474 --> 01:47:58.045
Im the one who got a favor from In-jae.

1111
01:48:01.114 --> 01:48:05.853
What are you doing?
I didnt do anything.

1112
01:48:07.621 --> 01:48:09.122
It hurts!

1113
01:48:09.556 --> 01:48:13.827
You have two previous convictions
for breaking into safes, right?

1114
01:48:14.561 --> 01:48:16.129
Cock sucker.

1115
01:48:17.931 --> 01:48:23.637
It was so long time ago.
Im retired after my marriage.

1116
01:48:24.538 --> 01:48:28.909
Our winning is up to you.
You can do it.

1117
01:49:05.979 --> 01:49:11.818
Yes, there was some
problem between he and I

1118
01:49:11.952 --> 01:49:14.555
so I attempted to meet Jang In-jae.

1119
01:49:15.289 --> 01:49:17.658
But he attacked me that night.

1120
01:49:17.791 --> 01:49:20.961
- Here.
- The whole place was a mess.

1121
01:49:21.495 --> 01:49:23.096
And He broke everything, hit everyone.

1122
01:49:24.364 --> 01:49:26.466
You were so scared.

1123
01:49:26.733 --> 01:49:29.970
Of course, I cant even sleep.

1124
01:49:30.170 --> 01:49:31.138
As you heard.

1125
01:49:32.272 --> 01:49:34.708
- Jin-kyung, go for it!
- Go.

1126
01:49:36.677 --> 01:49:38.278
Cross examine, please.

1127
01:49:39.479 --> 01:49:42.576
Its occupied... huh? You bitch!

1128
01:49:43.617 --> 01:49:44.451
Talk to you later.

1129
01:49:52.359 --> 01:49:53.694
I would like to produce evidence.

1130
01:49:58.165 --> 01:50:00.200
Hey, this is recording now?

1131
01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:00.901
Yes, boss.

1132
01:50:01.301 --> 01:50:03.103
Why you wanna record this?

1133
01:50:04.972 --> 01:50:06.740
How can we believe prosecutor Bong?

1134
01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.576
Im recording this tape in case.

1135
01:50:10.143 --> 01:50:11.712
He cannot betray us!

1136
01:50:13.881 --> 01:50:14.982
So you understand?

1137
01:50:15.048 --> 01:50:18.852
Sure, you want to set a trap
for Jang In-jae.

1138
01:50:19.786 --> 01:50:22.256
Anyway Im planning to suck him up.

1139
01:50:23.357 --> 01:50:25.492
Can I believe you?

1140
01:50:26.393 --> 01:50:29.496
Dont worry about it.

1141
01:50:29.496 --> 01:50:32.299
Just carry out my order.
And watch your mouth.

1142
01:50:32.733 --> 01:50:34.601
OK, I believe you.

1143
01:50:37.404 --> 01:50:38.038
Sure.

1144
01:50:44.178 --> 01:50:49.750
Your honor! Its a trap!
Who is that guy?

1145
01:50:52.186 --> 01:50:53.620
The tape Im about to show you

1146
01:50:53.854 --> 01:50:57.424
will embarrass you as it has me.

1147
01:50:58.458 --> 01:51:00.794
Mr. Bong has brought shame

1148
01:51:01.094 --> 01:51:03.630
to all prosecutors

1149
01:51:03.864 --> 01:51:07.201
who work for protecting justice,
Im so upset.

1150
01:51:08.735 --> 01:51:10.871
In-jae fell into trap

1151
01:51:11.305 --> 01:51:13.640
just because he was a gangster.

1152
01:51:13.774 --> 01:51:18.212
He is the real victim in this case.

1153
01:51:18.679 --> 01:51:23.717
Youve got to investigate Mr. Bong,

1154
01:51:23.717 --> 01:51:26.053
and make sure that
he pays for his crime.

1155
01:51:26.086 --> 01:51:27.254
Our hometown.

1156
01:51:27.421 --> 01:51:33.594
We cannot forgive Mr. Bong!
Motherfucker!

1157
01:51:34.895 --> 01:51:35.796
Yes!

1158
01:51:38.098 --> 01:51:39.933
Stop!

1159
01:52:58.745 --> 01:53:00.414

1160
01:53:07.921 --> 01:53:09.723
Be born again

1161
01:53:28.175 --> 01:53:31.478
I dont know why Im so nervous.

1162
01:53:31.545 --> 01:53:33.313
Dont hang your head.

1163
01:53:33.914 --> 01:53:39.286
She was a prosecutor
but were historic family.

1164
01:53:40.621 --> 01:53:43.857
Im Hong Duck-ja.

1165
01:53:44.057 --> 01:53:48.395
Sure, women are more
powerful in our family.

1166
01:53:48.962 --> 01:53:51.231
Shut up, bitch!

1167
01:54:02.075 --> 01:54:06.280
Wow, are you Duck-ja?
Hong Duck-ja!

1168
01:54:07.648 --> 01:54:10.150
Sweetheart?

1169
01:54:11.218 --> 01:54:13.387

1170
01:54:13.453 --> 01:54:18.292

1172
01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:21.161
What?

1173
01:54:21.261 --> 01:54:27.768
I remember
you were such a cute little girl.

1174
01:54:27.835 --> 01:54:31.205
You were cute too, sweetheart.

1175
01:54:32.573 --> 01:54:35.676

1176
01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:39.046
Thats OK, you have such a boyish face.

1177
01:54:39.179 --> 01:54:41.748
Dad, you dont want me to marry?

1178
01:54:41.982 --> 01:54:45.085
You're so young, not even thirty.

1179
01:54:45.185 --> 01:54:48.488
We have to reconsider this wedding.

1180
01:54:49.089 --> 01:54:52.559
Hey, lets just the two of us talk.

1181
01:54:52.626 --> 01:54:53.694
Thats good.

1182
01:54:54.494 --> 01:54:56.163

- M... mom!

1183
01:54:56.230 --> 01:54:57.998
Mom!
