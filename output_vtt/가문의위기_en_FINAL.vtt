00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.369
Mom!


00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:55.916
Mom, Mom!


00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:06.627
48 minutes and 37 seconds. You took frigging long. I could’ve been dead by now! God damn it!


00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.265
What happened? What do you think?


00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.134
It was a test to see how fast you’d get here.


00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:44.064
This whole thing was a test? Listen. A constant effort is needed to protect our family. You should be ready at all times. Got it? You have no faith in me. It’s not that. Your big brother did it, too. Really? How long did it take him? Less than 30 minutes. And he came alone.


00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:56.076
I can’t believe you brought two minions. There’s no comparison, Mom. I’m no match for him. You’re right on that.


00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.084
- You know what? I miss him. - You’re at it again.


00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:06.787
Mom!


00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.858
Mom!


00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:15.729
What the hell happened? Save it!


00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:33.847
What’s this? What the hell were you doing? Beats me. -You’re pathetic. -It hurts. Stop planting trees around. You’ll build a forest before you know it. You’re beyond help, SOB! Get a life!


00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:46.260
Who was it? Who kidnapped Mom? It’s over, Bro. Go finish planting a tree.


00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.534
I’m always left in the dark.


00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.518
Put it on a vibrating mode.


00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:48.522
Boss.


00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.158
It's time to go.


00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:16.016
This is my favorite song. - I know no songs. - What?


00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:25.492
You must be too busy with your business I like hard-working men like yourself.


00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:40.974
I go to work at 2 p.m. and get off at 6. God, that’s a life. I don’t like a hectic life. I like taking it easy.


00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:56.089
And I drink every night. Drinking? I absolutely love it. 5 shots of boilermaker get me, though. Like a blinking light.


00:06:02.763 --> 00:06:04.665
Hyo-jung, right?


00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:09.236
- Do you have time? - A lot.


00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:13.173
What about pride?


00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:16.009
None.


00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.879
You’re senseless, and I’m rude.


00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:21.448
Let’s not waste time.


00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.083
Excuse me.


00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:40.133
What could’ve gone wrong?


00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:42.102
I’m sorry.


00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.776
He’s so cool.


00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:04.825
What’s wrong with her?


00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:09.596
What kind of chick would you like?


00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:14.368
Let me tell you. You’re too picky with girls.


00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:20.607
You’ll never know. Okay?


00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:03.917
You okay, Boss? You bastard!


00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:33.747
Hi.


00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:43.757
Hi, Miss Prosecutor.


00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:47.694
Let go!


00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:52.332
Bingo!


00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.704
A padded bra?


00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:03.744
What do you take yourself for? An utility pole?


00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:06.246
Have a seat.


00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:27.568
It’s all there.


00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.337
You can’t bribe me with that.


00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.206
No way.


00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:41.315
I’ll have a box full of cash delivered to you. You don’t get it, do you? Money won’t do.


00:09:42.049 --> 00:10:02.469
Especially if it’s from a thug like you. You came to return the money, wearing a wire? To bust my ass? Let me tell you. I always check faces of those that I’m arresting. Don’t be so uptight. Have some juice and relax.


00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.739
We’ll talk then.


00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.525
Thought I’d drink it?


00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:28.462
I know your trick.


00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:32.666
You put drugs in it! You got me there.


00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:41.775
I thought you might like getting high. -You son of a... -Gulp it down.


00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:48.048
Once you get high, my boys will gang-bang you.


00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:53.587
What? A gangbang? Why upset?


00:10:54.121 --> 00:11:04.731
After the gangbang, we’ll sell you off to an island. Hey! I’m KIM Jin-kyung, a prosecutor of violent crimes!


00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:10.404
A gangbang? I’ll break your skull!


00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:12.840
Sell me off to an island?


00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:17.511
What the fuck do you take a prosecutor for?!


00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:20.080
I’ll kick your ass!


00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:25.719
You drank it.


00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:41.768
You’re... dead meat.


00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:48.708
Strip her and take pictures. My pleasure.


00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.948
Bitch!


00:11:58.352 --> 00:11:59.586
Hot!


00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.604
Get her!


00:12:39.393 --> 00:12:42.796
God damn it! See which floor she gets off!


00:12:56.944 --> 00:13:03.417
Mister, help me. Miss! Are you okay?


00:13:04.518 --> 00:13:07.821
Wake up, Miss. Miss?


00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:16.763
Mind your own business and hit the road.


00:13:17.197 --> 00:13:18.966
I can’t do that.


00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:20.667
You’ll regret it.


00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:23.270
Beat it before I make you.


00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:25.606
Asshole!


00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:18.692
You son of a bitch!


00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:35.342
What’s going on here?


00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:41.815
When’d you become a cop? I bought it at the market.


00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:45.452
Anyway, who were those fucks?


00:15:13.814 --> 00:15:15.315
It stinks!


00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:25.259
Why strip her?


00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:28.762
Look at this. I had no choice.


00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.708
Have fun, Boss.


00:15:56.023 --> 00:15:58.091
So strange.


00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.628
She’s a carbon copy of Jin-sook.


00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:06.834
This tearoom is so nice.


00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:15.876
This is the coolest one in Seoul. It’s called a café up here, not a tearoom. A café?


00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:18.078
What does it mean? “To hit”?


00:16:19.213 --> 00:16:23.317
No. A place to drink coffee.


00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:29.489
Man, you’re such a genius.


00:16:29.756 --> 00:16:31.391
Ready to order?


00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:44.238
Shit, it’s all in English.


00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:47.407
Coffee will do for me. Make it cold.


00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:49.309
You want an iced coffee?


00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:57.384
- No, a cold coffee. - Yes, an iced coffee. No, a cold coffee with ice in it!


00:16:57.918 --> 00:17:00.587
- Make it ice-cold. - Beat it!


00:17:01.955 --> 00:17:05.158
I can’t believe that bitch.


00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:12.399
Why can’t she just get us what we order? They must be out of cold coffee.


00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:27.548
What’s this? You do have a cold coffee. Why’d you lie? She must’ve borrowed some from next door.


00:17:29.283 --> 00:17:42.296
Wait. We didn’t order this. They give you an extra here in Seoul. -So it’s like a baby? -That’s right.


00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:49.670
- Too sweet! - You’re sweeter!


00:17:50.704 --> 00:17:52.973
She made it too sweet.


00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:55.375
Too bitter!


00:17:56.176 --> 00:17:59.680
That bitch ruined it. So bitter.


00:19:15.022 --> 00:19:21.828
You had a close call. It’s not broken, is it?


00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:35.442
Penis never gets broken, but torn off. Some ignorant thugs say, “My cock is broken.” But let me tell you. That’s just plain wrong. Okay.


00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:40.247
But it’s...


00:19:42.683 --> 00:19:44.184
Oh, these metal balls?


00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:50.657
I had to remove them for the procedure. How many?


00:19:51.258 --> 00:19:55.495
2, 4, 6, 8, 10. You put in so many.


00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:07.608
We don’t use these cheap, low-quality balls. A lot of side effects, and very bad for your body. I see.


00:20:08.442 --> 00:20:14.348
At our hospital, we only use top-quality metal balls.


00:20:14.715 --> 00:20:17.451
You want them inserted?


00:20:18.018 --> 00:20:26.560
No. I think I can do without them. Suit yourself. Until your penis heals...


00:20:29.696 --> 00:20:33.233
You need to keep this on for a few days.


00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.039
Should I put it on you?


00:21:00.561 --> 00:21:04.798
Once you get high, my boys will gang-bang you.


00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:10.804
After the gangbang, I’ll sell you off to an island.


00:22:04.591 --> 00:22:06.059
Weren’t you cold?


00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:08.695
Who are you?


00:22:09.263 --> 00:22:13.166
Why are you naked? Do you know who I am? That’s...


00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.501
Answer me now!


00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:42.329
You don’t remember? Last night in the parking lot... The parking lot? What did you do to me? Nothing. You were unconscious, and I didn’t know where you live. So you brought me here? It’s not what you think. You touched me, didn’t you? You’re dead!


00:22:43.063 --> 00:22:46.166
I never touched you!


00:22:48.635 --> 00:22:50.604
You did me with that ugly thing!


00:22:57.878 --> 00:23:00.180
Nothing happened. Trust me.


00:23:00.981 --> 00:23:03.550
Stay back, or I’ll kill you.


00:23:03.917 --> 00:23:07.087
Where are my clothes? Bring them!


00:23:30.544 --> 00:23:31.812
Is she okay?


00:23:48.061 --> 00:23:51.932
You plant trees in and out of the house.


00:23:52.232 --> 00:24:00.174
You should be awarded. Arbor Day isn’t the only day to plant trees.


00:24:02.376 --> 00:24:04.845
I’m a bare mountain.


00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:14.855
You’re overdoing it again. Okay, fine. I’ll turn you into a jungle.


00:24:17.324 --> 00:24:20.093
Good morning, Sir.


00:24:40.714 --> 00:24:42.282
Let’s see.


00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.655
Was it good, Boss?


00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:52.526
It’s not that.


00:24:53.861 --> 00:24:57.030
Don’t be shy with me.


00:24:58.732 --> 00:25:01.034
Nothing happened.


00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:03.537
No shit.


00:25:05.305 --> 00:25:07.407
How’s that possible?


00:25:07.741 --> 00:25:12.613
You remember my ex, Jin-sook?


00:25:13.247 --> 00:25:19.253
One with a crazy perm? Yeah, I remember her. Doesn’t she look like her?


00:25:20.053 --> 00:25:22.523
- Very much so, Boss. - Right.


00:25:23.023 --> 00:25:29.429
So you banged her all night until your cock got swollen?


00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:36.170
I said nothing happened. Pull your pants up. Okay.


00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:38.872
And...


00:25:40.507 --> 00:25:42.209
- Come here. - Okay.


00:25:44.011 --> 00:25:49.750
Your damn fly is open. - Let me zip it. - You can’t go in there!


00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:06.867
- How are you? - Who are you? We’re social workers from ‘Share Love.’ So what?


00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:11.738
You can help the needy and share love.


00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:22.983
So you’re saying you wanna help the poor... By extorting money from us? That’s not it. If you make a donation...


00:26:23.083 --> 00:26:32.326
That’s extortion! You bastard! Let me teach you who we are. Jong-myun.


00:26:32.826 --> 00:26:52.179
Once we help them, they’ll come back for more. Life is pain. They need to be independent. You don’t watch the news? That famous doctor has succeeded in copying humans... ...and Babel Prize... Son of a bitch!


00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:57.885
- Hey. - Yes, Boss? You’re not making sense. I’m sorry. He got me too upset.


00:26:59.786 --> 00:27:00.587
Come here.


00:27:01.722 --> 00:27:02.523
Okay.


00:27:10.264 --> 00:27:11.331
1 grand?!


00:27:15.402 --> 00:27:23.610
Here’s my name card. Call me anytime. I can drop by and tell you all about our work.


00:27:25.212 --> 00:27:28.448
Your family name is JANG. Family origin?


00:27:29.416 --> 00:27:41.528
It’s Ik-san. Really? Me, too! Is that right? What family are you from? - White Tiger Family. - White tiger?


00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:44.865
Wanna join the family?


00:27:45.632 --> 00:27:50.404
Good with knives? Thank you. Bye.


00:27:51.104 --> 00:27:52.539
Nice meeting you.


00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.413
We JANGs are all handsome.


00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.789
-Jin-kyung! -BONG.


00:28:09.556 --> 00:28:12.426
What happened last night? Are you okay?


00:28:12.759 --> 00:28:14.828
You got me worried sick.


00:28:16.096 --> 00:28:17.664
I’m fine, am I not?


00:28:18.398 --> 00:28:32.446
You’re gonna let them go? No way. Pick them up right now. A little bird told me that they traffic drugs. I’m waiting for a bigger bust.


00:28:36.617 --> 00:28:39.486
- I’m so sorry. - No problem.


00:28:40.087 --> 00:28:46.727
Jin-kyung, it’s a CCTV tape from that hotel. - Of the parking lot? - Right.


00:29:10.817 --> 00:29:15.522
Bite your teeth hard, asshole. You feel that?


00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:23.931
Come on, keep your head up. Not too high, asshole.


00:29:24.932 --> 00:29:27.301
You feel that? We’re not done yet!


00:29:27.668 --> 00:29:29.303
You’re pathetic.


00:29:29.703 --> 00:29:34.341
Why are you messing around with a sandbag? What’d it do to you?


00:29:35.309 --> 00:29:41.682
I have to train constantly to protect our family. Prevention is better than cure.


00:29:43.884 --> 00:29:49.122
How about trying harder in bed if you value the family?


00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:55.596
What are you saying? Producing children is also helping the family.


00:29:55.929 --> 00:29:59.800
What? Stop nagging me, bitch, before I make you.


00:30:03.537 --> 00:30:18.685
Let go of my arm. Right now! Let me jog your memory. I ruled the high school. Don’t forget that. Don’t push the button.


00:30:20.521 --> 00:30:23.323
Mother’s looking for you.


00:30:24.391 --> 00:30:26.627
This is embarrassing.


00:30:27.961 --> 00:30:31.331
- You called them in Seoul? - Yes.


00:30:31.865 --> 00:30:33.333
And?


00:30:33.901 --> 00:30:40.741
They tried to hook him up, but he turned them all down.


00:30:41.408 --> 00:30:42.342
What?


00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:54.521
Go to Seoul and find him a wife by my birthday next month. Understood? Okay, Mom. By my birthday!


00:30:57.991 --> 00:31:02.996
Hello? Young-mi? It’s me, Suk-jae.


00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:09.937
I bought you a cell phone. Remember? One with a thick accent.


00:31:11.004 --> 00:31:13.440
I’m coming to Seoul today.


00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.245
Anything you want?


00:31:19.146 --> 00:31:27.588
What dung? Louis VuiDung? You want me to buy you dung?


00:31:27.855 --> 00:31:28.856
You’re hurting me!


00:31:29.857 --> 00:31:33.694
Oh, it’s a brand name? No problem.


00:31:34.862 --> 00:31:37.464
I’ll call you when I’m in town.


00:31:38.932 --> 00:31:40.834
Not too hard!


00:31:43.036 --> 00:31:47.241
Who on earth would name their brand Dung?


00:31:47.908 --> 00:31:54.014
You never buy me anything. You’re not pretty enough.


00:31:54.648 --> 00:32:00.821
You buy her Louis Vuitton. Why not me?


00:32:01.421 --> 00:32:09.463
You’re a hooker, and she’s not. Be grateful that I hire you once a week!


00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:13.600
Suk-jae, keep it up, and I’ll tell your wife!


00:32:17.104 --> 00:32:27.781
You’re so hot-tempered. Okay, fine. I’ll buy you dung, too. - Really? - Of course.


00:32:31.218 --> 00:32:36.056
You hold onto boobs all day. What are you, a calf?


00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:45.032
We’re leaving now. Can I finish what I’ve started? There are boobs in Seoul, too. Where’s the fire?


00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:48.135
That asshole is too pushy.


00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:55.142
We’ll finish this later.


00:32:57.845 --> 00:32:58.779
Okay.


00:33:04.117 --> 00:33:05.085
Who is it?


00:33:07.321 --> 00:33:09.623
Right after I fell asleep!


00:33:14.261 --> 00:33:15.229
Hi.


00:33:17.331 --> 00:33:18.098
Hi.


00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:25.072
- Can I come in? - Sure, but...


00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.671
Bravo!


00:34:02.176 --> 00:34:06.480
Sorry about this morning. I didn’t know you’d saved me.


00:34:07.748 --> 00:34:12.586
Well... it’s nothing.


00:34:13.453 --> 00:34:15.022
Thanks for saving my life.


00:34:17.224 --> 00:34:20.227
No, don’t mention it.


00:34:22.796 --> 00:34:29.469
I don’t even know your name.


00:34:30.904 --> 00:34:31.972
You want to?


00:34:34.308 --> 00:34:34.975
Yes...


00:34:36.844 --> 00:34:42.616
My name is... My name is...


00:34:49.122 --> 00:34:51.992
Was I in your dream, Bro?


00:34:55.562 --> 00:34:56.897
Were you dreaming?


00:34:57.231 --> 00:34:59.833
- Suk-jae. - Yeah, it’s me.


00:35:00.601 --> 00:35:04.838
What are you doing here? Mom sent us.


00:35:05.439 --> 00:35:06.573
Why?


00:35:06.773 --> 00:35:25.392
We were told to find you a wife by her birthday. Otherwise, she’s gonna marry you to any girl she sees. She’s at it again. What can we do? We have to bring back you and your wife-to-be.


00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:30.564
Don’t worry. I’ll handle it.


00:35:31.298 --> 00:35:45.445
Since you’re here, Why don’t we go drinking? I want to. But I gotta go buy dung and plant a tree. I’ll take a rain check. We should let him rest. Let’s go.


00:35:45.779 --> 00:35:48.081
- Go back to bed. - Sleep tight.


00:36:04.064 --> 00:36:05.199
It’s not locked.


00:36:09.169 --> 00:36:10.404
It’s open.


00:36:16.376 --> 00:36:18.245
I don’t have any laundry to...


00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:33.994
Hi.


00:36:35.696 --> 00:36:38.031
What brings you here?


00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.337
- To return your clothes. - Yes...


00:36:47.774 --> 00:37:00.220
Sorry about this morning. I wasn’t myself and forgot to thank you. Okay then. Bye.


00:37:07.327 --> 00:37:10.898
- Can I have your name card? - Sure.


00:37:35.689 --> 00:37:38.058
You’re a social worker?


00:37:38.625 --> 00:37:39.927
How nice.


00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:45.732
Can I have yours?


00:37:46.033 --> 00:37:55.142
I don’t have one. But I’ll call you tomorrow. Your name?


00:37:55.776 --> 00:37:59.346
Jin-kyung. KIM Jin-kyung.


00:38:01.048 --> 00:38:02.182
Jong-myun?


00:38:03.116 --> 00:38:07.821
You have that guy’s card from Share Love?


00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:13.927
Yeah, that one. Buy out his number by morning.


00:38:20.033 --> 00:38:21.168
Are you eating, Boss?


00:38:27.508 --> 00:38:29.343
What do I look like I’m doing?


00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:32.779
Sorry.


00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:39.086
- How did it go? - It’s been taken care of. Good.


00:38:42.155 --> 00:38:43.423
What’s going on out there?


00:38:45.993 --> 00:38:49.730
Should I knock your teeth out?


00:38:50.898 --> 00:38:52.666
Keep you head up.


00:38:55.402 --> 00:39:00.541
Don’t I look familiar? Your guts are spilling all over. Stop hitting me.


00:39:01.108 --> 00:39:03.443
How could you extort money from a gangster?


00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:15.155
- I didn’t. - Shut up! Where were you thinking? We were just trying to help those in need. Where’s this society going? Asshole!


00:39:21.195 --> 00:39:21.862
Look.


00:39:32.673 --> 00:39:33.574
What’s going on?


00:39:33.774 --> 00:39:36.944
You told him to get him, didn’t you?


00:39:39.046 --> 00:39:57.064
I know things are tough these days. But extorting money from a gangster? That’s completely crazy. I told you to get his number. Not his organization, fool.


00:39:58.699 --> 00:40:01.768
- I’m sorry, Boss. - You’re an idiot!


00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:09.877
What the fuck goes on in your damn head?


00:40:12.312 --> 00:40:16.917
Suk-jae, What can I do with this head?


00:40:18.018 --> 00:40:22.022
You can use it to balance yourself, asshole.


00:40:25.192 --> 00:40:31.131
That’s right. Nobody can beat this deal.


00:40:31.732 --> 00:40:33.867
Hold on a second.


00:40:37.137 --> 00:40:45.979
Share Love. May I help you? KIM Jin-kyung? I’ll fucking put you... I’ll put you through.


00:40:46.747 --> 00:40:48.882
It’s KIM Jin-kyung, sir.


00:40:49.783 --> 00:40:57.224
Jin-kyung? Hi. What? Dinner?


00:40:59.293 --> 00:41:10.204
You took care of it? Yes, we gave them money for hospital. And we’ll meet later to discuss our partnership. - Good. - Sure.


00:41:10.971 --> 00:41:14.141
- What about name cards? - Right here.


00:41:15.142 --> 00:41:21.481
Why social work suddenly? It’s not our cup of tea.


00:41:22.216 --> 00:41:27.221
If we’re gonna do it, let’s change the name first.


00:41:27.754 --> 00:41:35.195
‘Share Love’ is so corny. Isn’t it? Yeah, it sounds like we are promoting orgies.


00:41:36.797 --> 00:41:38.232
Any ideas?


00:41:38.498 --> 00:41:42.436
It’s a global age. Why don’t we make it in English?


00:41:44.238 --> 00:41:54.214
Anything good in mind? Of course! We are introducing a new business. So we’re like a MC. Right.


00:41:54.748 --> 00:42:00.420
A MC launching a business... What about ‘MC Business’?


00:42:03.056 --> 00:42:05.058
You must study English hard.


00:42:06.093 --> 00:42:07.494
You go to an academy?


00:42:09.463 --> 00:42:21.275
But it's too difficult. Yes, we‘re not good at English. Korean is better. It‘s your problem. I study hard these days.


00:42:27.714 --> 00:42:30.551
Do you know what an orange is called in English?


00:42:30.851 --> 00:42:32.085
Orange?


00:42:34.154 --> 00:42:37.057
I know it... Orange... Orange...


00:42:37.324 --> 00:42:39.259
It‘s... It‘s on the tip of my tongue.


00:42:39.526 --> 00:42:44.231
Orange, orange... Hey, Jon-myun! You can tell me instead of me.


00:42:45.999 --> 00:42:56.176
Jong-myun, do you know it? How can I know it. - You don‘t know me yet? - Why are you yelling at me? Bitch! I forget again because he yelled.


00:42:57.811 --> 00:43:04.384
So tell me what is it? You all idiots. It‘s Delmont!


00:43:04.451 --> 00:43:08.388
Right, Delmont! I only remembered Del.


00:43:12.025 --> 00:43:15.462
Maybe there‘s an eraser in my head. So get it out, fool.


00:43:15.462 --> 00:43:17.965
What a pity. I almost remembered.


00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.135
- Seok-jae. - Yes, bro.


00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:25.072
What is Sunkist in English?


00:43:41.822 --> 00:43:45.125
Why you didn‘t tell you saved me?


00:43:45.125 --> 00:43:48.295
I‘m OK if you are safe.


00:43:51.899 --> 00:43:57.104
Dae-su, I have a question about your business. ‘Sharing Love’.


00:43:58.172 --> 00:44:00.207
Can you tell me about it?


00:44:00.774 --> 00:44:02.743
Well...


00:44:06.146 --> 00:44:17.191
we establish a healthy contribution culture and help needy neighbor...and...


00:44:17.658 --> 00:44:19.893
It‘s a great job.


00:44:22.462 --> 00:44:26.934
But I don‘t know what you do yet.


00:44:27.534 --> 00:44:33.473
Me? I‘m an... official.


00:44:34.908 --> 00:44:37.010
Ah, you serve your country.


00:44:37.945 --> 00:44:41.014
So what were you doing at the hotel?


00:44:42.282 --> 00:44:44.952
Well, I had something to return...


00:44:46.286 --> 00:44:49.156
If you have problem again, call me.


00:44:52.759 --> 00:44:56.363
I‘ll give you a new name card.


00:45:00.767 --> 00:45:08.442
Jang In-jae? The name is changed. It was Dae-su in old one.


00:45:12.913 --> 00:45:18.318
Dae-su Jang In-jae. It‘s my alias.


00:45:19.953 --> 00:45:24.458
Wow, you have an alias?


00:45:30.631 --> 00:45:32.432
I‘ll do it for you.


00:45:39.606 --> 00:45:44.611
Where did you go? I‘m waiting for you. Why?


00:45:45.712 --> 00:45:46.513
What‘s that?


00:45:47.948 --> 00:45:51.084
I prepared this for your wedding.


00:45:51.985 --> 00:45:55.322
Watch carefully and pick one.


00:45:55.422 --> 00:46:00.027
I‘m OK, you pick one. I don‘t need it. I‘m already married.


00:46:01.461 --> 00:46:09.336
I‘m seeing someone. So don‘t do that again. You have girlfriend? I had dinner with her.


00:46:10.103 --> 00:46:20.581
Wow, my brother finally get a tree to plant? Is she beautiful?


00:46:21.281 --> 00:46:25.552
She‘s beautiful, and a public official.


00:46:25.886 --> 00:46:35.295
Public official? That‘s nice. Mom always wanted a smart daughter in law. Well, your wife is an ignorant person.


00:46:36.496 --> 00:46:40.534
Son of bitch! I know that.


00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:45.005
Someone‘s here. Open the door.


00:46:45.906 --> 00:46:49.176
What did you say? It‘s a letter massage.


00:46:50.143 --> 00:46:52.980
Who? That...


00:46:53.947 --> 00:46:56.016
Hey, let letter massage come in.


00:46:59.753 --> 00:47:01.021
Where are you going?


00:47:01.522 --> 00:47:05.092
You two are fool brothers.


00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:17.137
What is it?


00:47:17.571 --> 00:47:30.884
It‘s smuggled goods from China ‘Breast cream’. Breast cream? What‘s that? You haven‘t heard of it? It makes woman‘s boobs get bigger. Wow, that‘s amazing.


00:47:32.085 --> 00:47:38.292
Hey, you want one? What? You‘ve got to be kidding. Or two?


00:47:39.593 --> 00:47:41.628
Hyo-suck, you want some?


00:47:42.563 --> 00:47:44.598
I don‘t need it.


00:48:00.747 --> 00:48:01.448
What are you doing?


00:48:04.885 --> 00:48:07.654
Ah, I‘m working.


00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:11.091
What?


00:48:13.427 --> 00:48:17.531
You look like you‘re trying to cover something up.


00:48:18.632 --> 00:48:22.236
I have nothing to hide.


00:48:22.369 --> 00:48:25.839
That‘s not true. You can‘t avoid my intuition.


00:48:26.773 --> 00:48:27.741
What‘s this? What?


00:48:28.041 --> 00:48:28.876
What are you doing?


00:48:29.176 --> 00:48:31.078
Let me see. I got it!


00:48:31.545 --> 00:48:33.981
I‘m very good at collecting evidence.


00:48:34.848 --> 00:48:37.217
Jang In-jae, Sharing Love.


00:48:37.784 --> 00:48:40.687
You didn‘t have dinner with me because of him?


00:48:41.955 --> 00:48:43.590
Stop it, it‘s not funny.


00:48:44.491 --> 00:48:48.896
You‘re evading a statement now. You‘re asking a leading question.


00:48:49.830 --> 00:49:08.415
Well, are you free tonight? I‘m sorry, today is tough. Are you going to meet that guy? It seems like a personal relationship. Let‘s drop it, OK? Get out, please. You have the right to refuse to answer questions.


00:49:09.183 --> 00:49:11.218
OK, let‘s stop here.


00:49:21.528 --> 00:49:23.630
She‘s strange.


00:49:26.099 --> 00:49:30.337
Hello. Yes, Jin-kyung.


00:49:35.042 --> 00:49:48.956
OK, sure. See you later. Look at you. You‘re smiling from ear to ear. He‘s totally falling in love. Yes.


00:49:49.489 --> 00:49:51.091
You already sleep with her?


00:49:51.758 --> 00:49:58.098
Who knows? Their love will be matured. Tell us honestly, bro.


00:49:59.399 --> 00:50:01.335
Did you sleep with her?


00:50:05.205 --> 00:50:11.144
I can‘t even hold her hand yet. What? Even hand? What the hell...?


00:50:11.478 --> 00:50:24.591
Why didn‘t you do anything? When you meet a girl. Your rhythm is the most important thing. Only my rhythm.


00:50:32.065 --> 00:50:36.637
I feel heavy. I did it only in my mind.


00:50:37.871 --> 00:50:40.440
Boss, I have...


00:50:44.378 --> 00:50:46.346
I have good idea.


00:51:02.896 --> 00:51:07.801
The theater is the best place to kiss a girl, Boss.


00:51:08.602 --> 00:51:10.571
If you choose a horror movie,


00:51:10.971 --> 00:51:13.607
all you have to do is just sit down.


00:51:28.755 --> 00:51:34.862
- Don‘t say anything from now on. - Yes, boss.


00:51:37.731 --> 00:51:40.133
I brought burning shame on myself.


00:51:41.702 --> 00:51:44.171
So why did you believe me, boss.


00:52:52.272 --> 00:52:53.340
What‘s wrong?


00:52:55.242 --> 00:52:58.679
What‘s this? It‘s inferior crap!


00:53:04.351 --> 00:53:06.153
Damn it... In-jae?


00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.656
What, now?


00:53:10.791 --> 00:53:13.060
I‘m about to go out.


00:53:13.493 --> 00:53:15.462
OK, I‘m right there.


00:53:24.071 --> 00:53:28.375
If you wanna feel her boobs, a motorcycle is the best.


00:53:29.776 --> 00:53:34.915
Because she cannot help holding you tight.


00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:37.744
- Jin-kyung, Hold tight! - W...wait!


00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:10.611
Seok-jae, thank you.


00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:16.717
It‘s working, isn‘t it?


00:55:19.152 --> 00:55:23.290
That‘s why I said I‘m expert about erotic love.


00:55:27.027 --> 00:55:28.996
Give me another chance.


00:55:31.598 --> 00:55:35.102
