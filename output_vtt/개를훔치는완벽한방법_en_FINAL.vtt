00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.671
This is a fable by
a man named Aesop.

2
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:15.008
The hares decided that
they’ve had enough.

3
00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.244
Hunted by the lions,

4
00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.181
startled by wolves,

5
00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:26.420
and chased by eagles,
they all wanted to eat them.

6
00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:34.995
So rather than living this terrible life,
they decided to jump!
Into the pond and die!

7
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.534
But when they were falling
into the pond,

8
00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:47.174
the frogs were startled
and jumped out of the water.

9
00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:49.877
The moral of this story is,

10
00:01:50.177 --> 00:02:00.787
there is always someone
worse off than yourself.
So, don’t be too sad or disappointed
because you’re in a difficult situation.

11
00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:05.859
If Aesop was in my shoes,
could he have written that?

12
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.762
Definitely not.

13
00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:17.171
What?!
Getting a divorce?

14
00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:28.382
I knew it,
it doesn’t even surprise me.
She won’t accept alimony? Is she nuts?!
The way I see it, she’s the cheater.

15
00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:32.252
There’s evidence,
I heard some things.

16
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.493
That corner store owner...
Holy cow!
Why are they always hiding!

17
00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:46.133
Afternoon, ma’am.
License please.

18
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.868
I only spoke a few words.

19
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:49.670
License please.

20
00:02:51.538 --> 00:03:00.047
I only said 2 words,
give me a ticket for that.
You can’t just pick and choose.
- Come on, mister.
- Mom.
- Come on, mister.
- Mom.
It’s embarrassing.

21
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:12.993
My kid’s embarrassed, bill me for 2 words.
So anal... It’s the law, give it to me already.
- I’ll get off here.
- Where do you always go?
Your house’s far.

22
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.161
That way.

23
00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:18.031
Ma’am, I’ll get off here.

24
00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:23.403
Okay, take care.
- Whatever, Mr. Johnny Law.
- Don’t call me that, I’m an officer.

25
00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:29.243
- Okay, Mr. Officer, listen.
- Mom, I’ll be back!
Hey! You got private class!

26
00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.677
Do you know
how much that is?

27
00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:09.283
$250,000.

28
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.918
Been a while.

29
00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:18.000
I’m not just managing a restaurant.
Only the loaded VIPs dine here.

30
00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:28.802
- If we dated like I wanted, you could’ve been...
- Hey, drop it.
When can I start?
I’m in a bit of a rush.
Could you decide soon?

31
00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:35.609
Well, I have the hiring power,
but this is my aunt’s business.

32
00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:39.246
So there’s a protocol.
Let’s see.

33
00:04:39.413 --> 00:04:40.614
Where’s your address?

34
00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:44.618
Come on, you know me.

35
00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.255
- She’s here.
- Hurry up!

36
00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:50.624
Good afternoon, madam.

37
00:05:03.237 --> 00:05:07.241
She’s interviewing
for the extra hand...

38
00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:11.612
She looks pleasant.

39
00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:17.751
Wolly, let’s go upstairs.

40
00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:47.381
Don’t go there without my permission.
You’re not a beggar!
Who cares if my belly’s full.
You’re wrong!
Did you ever consider how others would see us?
It’s nice to get free stuff with your puppy eyes.
But life isn’t so easy.

41
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:50.617
Once you’re ignored,
it’s all over!

42
00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:51.919
Hey!

43
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:58.992
Hi.

44
00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:03.931
I’ve been following you
since the car.

45
00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:11.505
We... we’re...

46
00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:19.680
moving to a bigger house.
- Really?
- Yeah. Dad’s pizza shop’s doing so well.

47
00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:29.389
I see.
So, we’re staying here
for just one week.
One week?

48
00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:36.263
The house... isn’t ready...
Mom left us these for dinner.

49
00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:41.001
There’s hot water
at the corner store.

50
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:16.403
You’ll be embarrassed
to be with me.
- My mom’s far more embarrassing.
- We may become homeless.
Maybe we already are.

51
00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:20.641
Your mom won’t let you
play with me.

52
00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:28.615
I won’t hate you for it,
we don’t have to be friends.

53
00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:33.754
Let’s stay friends.

54
00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:36.990
You won’t tell anyone?

55
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.259
Not even your mom?

56
00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:46.266
Promise.

57
00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:53.373
I told you I’d get a job
right away.

58
00:07:53.507 --> 00:08:00.681
- I still got tricks up my sleeve.
- So, when do we buy a house?
You said it’d a week,
but it’s been a month.

59
00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:09.890
Go back to daycare,
I’ll pay the overdue fees.
Say you were on a trip.
I’m okay.

60
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.794
Go and play there.
That’d be more helpful.

61
00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:16.029
I can at least do that.

62
00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:18.365
Can’t we just go to auntie’s?

63
00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:29.009
- Not that again.
- Because of your pride?
No, it’s not about that!
Do you even know
what that means?
- I do, thanks to you.
- Seriously!

64
00:08:31.378 --> 00:08:37.484
What’s wrong? Not good?
Have another.
Dad’s pizza is
much better.

65
00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:46.126
We decided not to
talk about dad.
Can’t you bake it,
like dad did?

66
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:52.165
You know mom can’t cook.
She never cooked for us.

67
00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:55.302
Not because I can’t!

68
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.787
You can’t believe
everything moms say.

69
00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:21.261
Not everything they say is true,
and not everything they do
make sense.

70
00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:25.432
If mom was so smart,
she wouldn’t have married dad.

71
00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:30.003
Before we buy a house,
she’ll drive me insane.

72
00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:39.112
It’s not buying,
you get a ‘house deposit’.
What’s that?
It’s what adults call it instead.

73
00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:42.182
Is that expensive?

74
00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.384
Probably more than $100?

75
00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:51.291
Idiots.
There aren’t any
$100 deposits nowadays.
You girls don’t know anything.

76
00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:56.930
How much is your house?
Saw it during
my birthday party, right?

77
00:09:57.264 --> 00:10:01.301
It’s so much more than $100.
So how much is it?!

78
00:10:02.503 --> 00:10:04.004
About...

79
00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:05.672
$500?

80
00:10:07.407 --> 00:10:09.009
$500?!

81
00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:17.384
Ji-so!

82
00:10:18.252 --> 00:10:24.658
Did you ask your mom
about your party?
What? My party?
Yeah, your birthday’s next month.

83
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:32.132
That’s right.
Didn’t you want to have
a big party like Min-sup?

84
00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.134
Yes.

85
00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:47.681
You don’t have to.
Why? Who doesn’t like parties?
I don’t like parties at my place.
It’s like showing off.
Who doesn’t have
a house nowadays?

86
00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:54.788
I want to do it,
a big party at home.
Yeah? Then have your mom
call me.

87
00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:57.758
Okay.

88
00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:00.000
Bye.

89
00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:08.735
But you don’t have a house.
So I have to get one
before then.

90
00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:22.883
Chungdam, Won-dang,
New Villa, Per Square, Il-san...
“HANSAM REAL ESTATE”
I don’t understand this!

91
00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:33.760
This one,
how about this one?
So beautiful!
It’s perfect!
“$500 PER SQUARE!”
It costs $500 too.
It costs $500 too.
Perfect!

92
00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:37.364
But where’s ‘PER SQUARE’?

93
00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:42.002
Well, maybe beside Time Square?

94
00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:47.374
If so...
it’s a bit far from school.

95
00:11:47.508 --> 00:11:51.912
But you still have the van,
so it should be okay.

96
00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:57.885
Go away, children.

97
00:11:58.118 --> 00:12:00.120
Is this house really $500?

98
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.994
- Where’s your mom?
- Can I really buy this for $500?

99
00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:13.133
- If you want to know, bring your mom.
- Can’t you lower the price?

100
00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:18.672
$500 per square meter is very cheap.
It’s the best bargain in town.

101
00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:23.510
- That must be really great town.
- Sure.

102
00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:34.121
Wait, this isn’t what I ordered.

103
00:12:34.488 --> 00:12:40.260
You ordered beef tenderloin.
What are you talking about,
I ordered hamburger steak!

104
00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:43.864
- But you...
- Pardon me.

105
00:12:44.364 --> 00:12:46.166
That’s enough.

106
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.002
Okay, give me more enough.

107
00:12:49.903 --> 00:12:56.243
I gave you enough.
- Yes, one more enough.
- You already had enough.

108
00:12:57.878 --> 00:13:06.053
- We’ll get your order right.
- Will it take a long time?
- No, we’ll cook it as soon as possible.
- How many kids does she have?!

109
00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:12.860
Sweetie, did you see me work?

110
00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:16.797
Look.
Isn’t my uniform pretty?

111
00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.366
Do these look too chic?

112
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.174
Of course they are.
But you sold everything else.
I’ll buy them again
with the salary.

113
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.112
I’ll keep Ji-suk with me.

114
00:13:32.246 --> 00:13:36.517
Why don’t you
get the laundry done?

115
00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:44.124
Buy yourself some snack.

116
00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:47.127
I’m off.

117
00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:50.130
Mom!

118
00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:51.765
Do you...

119
00:13:54.134 --> 00:14:01.508
have $500?
What are you talking about?
Go on, don’t wander off.

120
00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:07.007
Come by after.
Depends.

121
00:15:12.112 --> 00:15:13.280
Huh?

122
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:29.496
Mister, I only got 8 coupons.
Can I add $2 and get a family size?

123
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.032
You know
perfectly well you can’t.

124
00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:37.738
Then I’ll give you 2 extra later,
can’t I get it upfront?

125
00:15:38.238 --> 00:15:44.111
Who gives
a free pizza upfront?
Little bugger,
life isn’t free.

126
00:15:45.546 --> 00:15:48.115
I threw some away
because I didn’t know.

127
00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:56.490
-You can’t smoke while kneading.
- You still won’t get anything.

128
00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:07.367
Hello?
Yes, Gold Villa.

129
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:11.872
Yes, family size.
Thank you.

130
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.910
Family size is F,
and regular is R.

131
00:16:18.412 --> 00:16:20.514
Do you even speak English?

132
00:16:57.885 --> 00:16:59.419
Do you need this?

133
00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:29.750
I’m so tired...

134
00:17:43.263 --> 00:17:56.410
How can a dog cost $500?
It says he guarded the President.
- It’s exactly $500.
- It’s a God-given chance.
- We have to find this dog.
- But how do we find him?

135
00:17:57.744 --> 00:18:04.151
We have to try everything.
Okay, for $500.
We’ll try everything.

136
00:18:04.618 --> 00:18:21.301
We can start with
the dog’s neighborhood.
It’s not like dogs can fly,
how far can they go?
We should call and see
if he’ll really pay $500.
I’m calling about Jinsam,
the President’s guard dog.

137
00:18:21.802 --> 00:18:29.243
Will you really pay
$500 to find him?
You won’t subtract taxes, right?

138
00:18:30.377 --> 00:18:31.378
What?!

139
00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:34.047
You found him?!

140
00:18:34.515 --> 00:18:36.517
He was in your front yard?!

141
00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:43.624
Just how big is your front yard?
You should’ve looked for him there first!

142
00:18:44.258 --> 00:18:47.027
Why?
I am in primary school.

143
00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:53.367
Can’t primary students
nitpick too?
REWARD $500
Do you know
how disappointed we are?!

144
00:19:14.388 --> 00:19:15.923
So steep...

145
00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:41.048
“TOWED VEHICLE LOT”
There’s towing and parking fees,
and the fine is due within 15 days.
There’s towing and parking fees,
and the fine is due within 15 days.

146
00:19:42.783 --> 00:19:51.925
- Towing and parking?
- Yes.
- I’m a bit short on cash, can’t I get a discount?
- No credit card?

147
00:19:54.928 --> 00:19:57.297
Can I use your phone
for a moment?

148
00:19:58.265 --> 00:19:59.633
No cellphone either?

149
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.669
We’re homeless,
how can we afford a cellphone!

150
00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:21.655
Stop that, it’s irritating!

151
00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:26.360
We were just here.

152
00:20:28.428 --> 00:20:38.305
How long
are we going to circle?
Is it my fault that
we got nowhere to go?
So let’s just go to auntie’s.

153
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.009
I’m really tired,
so don’t annoy me.

154
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:50.417
If we go there,
you have to transfer too!
So transfer, it’s no big deal.
Better than living like homeless.

155
00:20:57.391 --> 00:21:17.244
Where did you
get that stubbornness?!
Feels nice to say anything you want?!
Even if we live in a car,
you must attend a good school!
You just do
what I tell you!
Who’s the stubborn one?
Tell me, who?!
I think you’re both stubborn.

156
00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:27.254
- Do you know what’s coming up next month?
- Sports Day,thought I’d forget?
Seriously.

157
00:21:29.489 --> 00:21:30.891
Where you going?!

158
00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:34.494
Hey!

159
00:21:37.431 --> 00:21:38.866
Get back in here!

160
00:21:55.382 --> 00:22:00.254
Hey.
So you’ll have your party
at your house?

161
00:22:02.623 --> 00:22:03.991
Yes...

162
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:07.761
Do you live better than us?

163
00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:09.363
Bigger house?

164
00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:15.636
Min-sup, don’t even compare.

165
00:22:15.903 --> 00:22:20.541
Compare to hers,
yours is a dog house.

166
00:22:22.376 --> 00:22:23.911
- Really?
- Min-sup.

167
00:22:41.495 --> 00:22:42.996
Let’s steal a dog.

168
00:22:43.263 --> 00:22:52.506
- Steal what?
- Steal a $500 dog.
We’ll steal it and return it.
We will just take the reward money.

169
00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:08.488
- Don’t be late!
- Okay!

170
00:23:10.624 --> 00:23:12.292
Do you have a plan?

171
00:23:12.492 --> 00:23:14.661
We must find a dog first.

172
00:23:15.863 --> 00:23:18.131
Aren’t we doing a bad thing?

173
00:23:18.665 --> 00:23:24.238
So we should only do it once.
You can’t live
without doing bad things.

174
00:23:27.374 --> 00:23:36.250
1. Don’t steal from
a super rich family.
Why?
They can just buy a new one.
Only somewhat rich family
will be sad to lose a dog.

175
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:42.289
2. No children’s dog.
3. Steal from people
we wouldn’t feel sorry.

176
00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:45.859
4. Decent size to run with.

177
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:53.634
He mustn’t bark too much,
and not bite either.
5. President’s dogs or
guard dogs are too loud.

178
00:23:58.005 --> 00:24:01.141
What?
Do we have to keep
him around?

179
00:24:01.742 --> 00:24:04.611
He’s the 3rd generation
only son.

180
00:24:05.045 --> 00:24:15.489
Have to keep him around.
He’s too stupid to be any help.
People with “suk” in the name
are super stupid.

181
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.792
Come on, that’s not true.

182
00:24:19.626 --> 00:24:23.797
That’s what my mom said.
Sometimes, she’s right.

183
00:24:24.932 --> 00:24:27.801
Does you dad’s name
end with “suk”?

184
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:29.369
Yeah.

185
00:24:33.674 --> 00:24:35.542
3rd generation only son?

186
00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:43.116
Look how fat he is.
Soaked in happiness.

187
00:24:43.617 --> 00:24:45.886
Can we carry him?

188
00:24:47.387 --> 00:24:54.000
Maybe for a moment.
Where’ll you keep him
after stealing him?

189
00:24:59.366 --> 00:25:06.240
They’ll fit in our bag.
The owner wouldn’t care
if one of them disappeared.

190
00:25:07.307 --> 00:25:11.512
If we steal it,
we gotta feed it.

191
00:25:12.045 --> 00:25:14.615
Got money for dog food?

192
00:25:15.883 --> 00:25:21.288
- What are you kids doing there?
- Your puppies are really cute. Sorry!

193
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.630
There are cameras
everywhere now.

194
00:25:30.264 --> 00:25:32.299
What about those?

195
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.776
Take this,
and go to mom’s restaurant.

196
00:25:45.512 --> 00:25:53.387
What’s with you?!
- It’s not like you need skill to carry dishes.
- I haven’t been sleeping well lately.

197
00:25:53.654 --> 00:25:54.988
I’ll clean it up.

198
00:25:55.923 --> 00:25:59.126
You got a knack
for doing a bad job.

199
00:26:00.627 --> 00:26:02.129
Really?

200
00:26:02.996 --> 00:26:05.866
You can’t keep bringing
your kids here!

201
00:26:07.167 --> 00:26:08.235
Ji-suk!

202
00:26:08.502 --> 00:26:16.610
Maybe it’s my punch out time.
“Punch out”?
You still got 3 hours left!
Then I’ll give him some food
and send him away.

203
00:26:20.113 --> 00:26:21.615
Let’s eat ice cream!

204
00:26:22.516 --> 00:26:24.384
Choco or strawberry?

205
00:26:24.618 --> 00:26:27.120
Did you eat?
Let’s get some waffles too.

206
00:26:30.624 --> 00:26:31.491
Aunt...

207
00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:36.496
- Good afternoon, madam.
- I heard PARK found YOON’s final piece.

208
00:26:36.864 --> 00:26:52.880
Yes, it’ll be auctioned off this month.
- Very good. Get it and put it in my room.
- Yes, ma’am.
Oh yeah, Mr. PARK mentioned your will...
What does he mean...
Something’s odd,
why does it feel so weird?

209
00:26:54.882 --> 00:26:57.251
Should we change
the interior design?

210
00:26:57.885 --> 00:26:59.052
Forget it.

211
00:27:09.129 --> 00:27:10.764
Let’s drink water.

212
00:27:11.031 --> 00:27:12.499
Wait.

213
00:27:15.135 --> 00:27:24.044
Tell PARK not to worry
because it’s the last time.
How can an asset manager tremble
over a painting’s price tag?

214
00:27:25.913 --> 00:27:29.283
But it’s in the hundreds
and thousands...

215
00:27:31.618 --> 00:27:34.988
There’s just one more,
then it’s over.

216
00:27:37.658 --> 00:27:49.002
How about what PARK
proposed last time?
Rebuilding this place.
A skyscraper here would
multiply the profit...
- Su-young.
- Yes?

217
00:27:49.369 --> 00:27:52.239
Do you know why
dog’s better than men?

218
00:27:53.407 --> 00:27:55.742
They don’t talk,
not a word.

219
00:28:00.113 --> 00:28:07.387
Tell him I’ll contact him
when the will is done.
You’ll... finally complete it?
What’s with you?
Move aside!

220
00:28:13.861 --> 00:28:15.262
So weird...

221
00:28:17.631 --> 00:28:19.032
I understand, madam.

222
00:28:22.503 --> 00:28:31.745
- That dog belongs to very rich family, right?
- Yeah, and my mom works there.
- Really?
- Wanna have ice cream there?

223
00:28:31.879 --> 00:28:38.886
Can we really?
Mom doesn’t get paid much,
so we eat there often.

224
00:28:39.419 --> 00:28:44.791
You’ll get $500,000
to work with.
You can proceed with that.

225
00:28:46.627 --> 00:28:48.128
I told you already.

226
00:28:49.162 --> 00:28:50.998
Measly $500...

227
00:28:52.132 --> 00:28:55.135
Why do you make me
repeat myself?

228
00:28:57.304 --> 00:28:59.039
Fine.

229
00:29:02.743 --> 00:29:04.912
Why aren’t we going?

230
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.293
Where’s your mom?

231
00:29:20.127 --> 00:29:22.129
What the heck are you doing?!

232
00:29:22.262 --> 00:29:38.178
- I’m sorry, just this once.
- Are you nuts? Why bathe him here?!
Then could you?
Help me out for one more day.
I won’t bring him from tomorrow on.
We barely get 10 people a day,
it’s not like your hands are full.

233
00:29:38.412 --> 00:29:51.758
There’re more employees than customers.
Don’t be so stern.
Am I the boss here?
If it wasn’t for my aunt, I wouldn’t be.
I hear she’s using this place
to meet people, not for business.

234
00:29:52.125 --> 00:30:03.737
Don’t be so stern for
eating leftovers and using water.
Not a shred of humanity,
despite doing charity on the side.

235
00:30:04.004 --> 00:30:08.609
If you can’t say that to my aunt,
then don’t say it to my face!

236
00:30:09.276 --> 00:30:12.746
I don't know if I’m working,
or being a housewife.

237
00:30:13.247 --> 00:30:24.057
You see how impossible
she is?
No wonder her husband left her,
and her only son left home and died.
If I wasn’t the only one
to inherit Marcel, I’d have left.

238
00:30:29.863 --> 00:30:31.765
So righteous.

239
00:30:34.668 --> 00:30:45.012
You got it all wrong.
- Go apologize!
- I’m so sorry, madam!
- She’s a friend...
- Kick her out.
- I’m really sorry, I truly am...
- Aunt!

240
00:30:47.548 --> 00:30:53.787
Honestly, I don’t think
I’m cut out for service work.
This is good!

241
00:30:53.987 --> 00:31:00.160
I missed out on so many things
while raising you two.
I’ll now look for
my true calling.

242
00:31:00.861 --> 00:31:06.000
Oh yeah!
I got plenty of severance,
should we go to a hotel?

243
00:31:18.512 --> 00:31:22.249
A man named Aesop showed up
in my dreams recently.

244
00:31:22.783 --> 00:31:28.055
He wanted to tell me
‘the Hares and the Frogs’.

245
00:31:28.121 --> 00:31:31.925
I said I didn’t want to hear
the stupid tale.

246
00:31:33.126 --> 00:31:39.132
It’s only fair when a hare is
compared to another hare.

247
00:31:40.534 --> 00:31:44.671
In the end,
Aesop apologized to me.

248
00:31:45.038 --> 00:31:50.277
He said I was the most pitiful one,
not the hares nor the frogs.

249
00:31:50.544 --> 00:31:55.682
He wouldn’t have written
the story if he met me.

250
00:32:16.503 --> 00:32:19.506
Other kids will never know,

251
00:32:19.873 --> 00:32:23.277
how happy it is
to have a home.

252
00:32:27.014 --> 00:32:29.750
You wanna be called
a ‘stupid dad’?

253
00:32:30.017 --> 00:32:35.255
Would you understand
if I explained?
Do you even know
what her belt is?

254
00:32:36.123 --> 00:32:42.000
Yellow, it’s yellow!
What I’m saying is,
we can’t afford it right now.

255
00:32:42.262 --> 00:32:47.634
She attends private classes
but always dead last.
Listen to yourself!

256
00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:49.870
And she’s a red belt!

257
00:32:55.042 --> 00:32:58.278
Hey.
I’ve decided on the dog.

258
00:32:58.745 --> 00:32:59.680
Marcel?

259
00:33:10.057 --> 00:33:17.664
Okay.
He always has a leash,
and is freed only at the vet
once a day.

260
00:33:18.165 --> 00:33:26.006
No chance between
the restaurant and the clinic.
He always goes there
at this hour?

261
00:33:26.306 --> 00:33:27.307
Yup.

262
00:33:28.609 --> 00:33:31.245
Then let’s do it there.

263
00:33:32.012 --> 00:33:43.123
There’ll be too many eyes,
will it be okay?
Yeah.
It’ll take about 2 hours for check-up,
exercise, massage, and grooming.

264
00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:50.364
Mr. Su-young is always too busy
chatting with nurses,
so he’s not a problem.

265
00:33:51.265 --> 00:33:58.505
The problem is how to lure him
to end of the hallway.
How do we lure him
from here to here?

266
00:33:58.639 --> 00:34:00.807
Can’t we just carry him out?

267
00:34:02.409 --> 00:34:05.012
Just carry him out?

268
00:34:05.913 --> 00:34:18.125
There, and there,
people can see you clearly.
- Don’t you lure it with food?
- So strange...
A “suk” kid should be
really stupid.

269
00:34:18.492 --> 00:34:21.028
He still can’t write
alphabet yet.

270
00:34:21.361 --> 00:34:25.866
So did you find a place
to keep him?

271
00:34:31.872 --> 00:34:38.011
How cool am I?
- Awesome...
- Perfect, right?
Too perfect.

272
00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.013
There’s more.

273
00:34:43.617 --> 00:34:44.384
Watch.

274
00:34:55.162 --> 00:34:56.864
So amazing!

275
00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:59.766
We just have to
steal him now.

276
00:35:00.167 --> 00:35:02.369
Wait for it, coming soon!

277
00:35:08.876 --> 00:35:09.910
Tada!

278
00:35:11.378 --> 00:35:24.791
But she loves Marcel
too much.
We’re not talking about selling it.
Not sell, but invest in it.
You know I want to.
But it’s not mine,
what can I do?

279
00:35:25.659 --> 00:35:28.495
Madam’s finishing her will.

280
00:35:28.862 --> 00:35:32.633
You can proceed if Marcel is
listed as your inheritance.

281
00:35:33.901 --> 00:35:42.509
- Seriously?
- Of course!
All you need are notarized will
property deed and your consent form.

282
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:53.153
How do I convince her then?
Use your head for once.
When we break ground,
send her off to a senior home.

283
00:35:53.554 --> 00:35:59.159
No, I can’t.
There’s auction next month
and when she finishes the will,

284
00:35:59.626 --> 00:36:15.008
let’s speak again then.
What a coward!
This area is being redeveloped,
this is the only chance.
She’s so hung up
on the paintings
that she’ll go broke soon.

285
00:36:22.115 --> 00:36:24.985
Do you know
what time is it?!

286
00:36:25.419 --> 00:36:29.556
I had work to do,
just like you.

287
00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.926
But you can’t stay out
so late!

288
00:36:33.794 --> 00:36:36.630
I had things to
take care of.

289
00:36:38.632 --> 00:36:41.502
Fine, fine,
no more nagging today.

290
00:36:43.003 --> 00:36:45.005
Because today is
a happy day!

291
00:36:47.875 --> 00:36:51.512
I found us a home!
Really?

292
00:36:55.115 --> 00:36:56.917
We’re here!

293
00:37:09.496 --> 00:37:12.499
It’s my friend’s,
and it’s empty.

294
00:37:12.866 --> 00:37:18.305
She said we can use it
for a month or so.
Come in.

295
00:37:19.373 --> 00:37:20.741
Come!

296
00:37:40.761 --> 00:37:44.531
I always dreamt of
living in a proper house.

297
00:37:46.366 --> 00:37:49.803
So many rooms!
You can each use one.

298
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:54.908
It’s scary as is,
but sleep alone?

299
00:37:59.746 --> 00:38:06.000
It’s got water!
I didn’t expect this!
Mom, turn it off,
it sounds scary.

300
00:38:13.861 --> 00:38:15.128
Where are you going?

301
00:38:16.263 --> 00:38:18.632
- I’m gonna sleep in the van.
- Me too.

302
00:38:21.235 --> 00:38:25.672
Come here right this second!
Why won’t you listen to me!

303
00:38:26.139 --> 00:38:28.242
It’s a really great house!

304
00:38:28.675 --> 00:38:29.409
Hey!

305
00:38:31.111 --> 00:38:32.112
Hey!

306
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.517
I won’t let you in,
even if you wanted to come in.

307
00:38:36.617 --> 00:38:43.156
It’s so nice here!
This is so soft!
Nice and cozy!

308
00:38:44.758 --> 00:38:46.493
I heard you got a house.

309
00:38:46.994 --> 00:38:49.363
It’s not a house.

310
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.998
What do we do?

311
00:38:51.798 --> 00:38:54.134
- Let’s do it today.
- Today?

312
00:38:54.735 --> 00:39:03.610
Yeah, today.
Can we do it before
private class ends?
My mom’s taking interest
in me lately for some reason.

313
00:39:03.744 --> 00:39:06.880
When does the class end?
5 o’clock.

314
00:39:07.881 --> 00:39:09.883
30 minutes is enough.

315
00:39:11.652 --> 00:39:12.753
Faster!

316
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:37.377
Yes, you can come
and make a reservation.

317
00:39:53.126 --> 00:39:55.262
Wolly’s done!
Off you go!

318
00:40:33.367 --> 00:40:34.401
Okay, let’s go.

319
00:40:46.613 --> 00:40:49.516
He’s here!
Ji-so, pull it!

320
00:40:52.886 --> 00:40:54.388
Now, close it.

321
00:40:58.125 --> 00:41:00.127
- Grab him now!
- I got him!

322
00:41:01.261 --> 00:41:02.529
Just let go!

323
00:41:05.499 --> 00:41:07.234
- You okay?
- Yeah.

324
00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:10.304
- Where is he going?!
- Grab him! Grab him!

325
00:41:11.238 --> 00:41:13.740
- He’s heading outside!
- No!

326
00:41:42.236 --> 00:41:43.637
Hey, Wolly.

327
00:41:45.138 --> 00:41:46.740
Why’re you down here?

328
00:41:48.542 --> 00:41:50.377
That stupid mutt!

329
00:41:56.116 --> 00:41:57.384
Ji-so!

330
00:42:00.787 --> 00:42:03.123
What’s wrong?
Something happened?

331
00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.492
It was a hard day.

332
00:42:07.861 --> 00:42:13.000
You can wash up at the house.
We get water there.
Stop it, mom.

333
00:42:14.801 --> 00:42:16.136
What’s all this?

334
00:42:18.138 --> 00:42:22.009
I did some shopping!
To decorate our home!
Look at this!

335
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.613
Tada!
Home sweet home!

336
00:42:38.025 --> 00:42:40.427
That brat, so difficult...

337
00:43:00.781 --> 00:43:04.484
Give me a break!
It’s vacant anyways!

338
00:44:33.807 --> 00:44:37.611
My new job starts early,
so take care of Ji-suk.

339
00:44:39.613 --> 00:44:41.381
What kind of job?

340
00:44:43.016 --> 00:44:48.121
You don’t need to know.
Stay with him in the van
after school. Got it?

341
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:54.000
I’m really tired,
good night.

342
00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:59.626
THE PERFECT PLAN 2
We’ll observe it
under the microscope.

343
00:46:01.428 --> 00:46:04.865
Let’s forget the clinic,
it’s too dangerous.

344
00:46:06.366 --> 00:46:09.136
... put it on top of it nicely.

345
00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:13.540
Marcel’s more dangerous.

346
00:46:15.409 --> 00:46:19.746
That mutt is strong,
we may need help.

347
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:32.426
Bringing someone else in is
too dangerous.
Marcel’s our last chance.
We need an inside man.
Maybe Ji-suk remembers.
He was inside.

348
00:46:33.994 --> 00:46:41.001
Granny’s not there during lunch,
Wolly’s alone.
But 2 people here.

349
00:46:44.238 --> 00:46:51.612
- Why didn’t you tell us earlier?
- You never asked me. Not even once.

350
00:46:52.279 --> 00:47:03.257
Let’s use the same plan as before.
We still got dog food left, so it’ll work.
Once we get him outside...
we need to bring him here.

351
00:47:04.258 --> 00:47:07.861
But how’ll you bring
the dog from there?

352
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.369
We need a delivery man.

353
00:47:15.736 --> 00:47:17.137
Delivery...

354
00:47:18.005 --> 00:47:19.239
Delivery man.

355
00:47:21.175 --> 00:47:23.877
No questions, no whining,
just deliver?

356
00:47:25.112 --> 00:47:28.682
- Why should I?
- Why do you use ‘R’ for family size?

357
00:47:28.916 --> 00:47:35.389
- What?
- We calculated how much
you pocketedwith that scheme.

358
00:47:37.424 --> 00:47:39.993
I don’t know
what you’re talking about.

359
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:50.003
- I’ll spank you!
- We’ll keep this a secret.
You are doing something very bad.
Think of it was a punishment
for your crime.

360
00:47:51.038 --> 00:47:55.008
- It’s terrible to threaten an adult.
- Whatever.

361
00:47:58.879 --> 00:48:00.681
Okay, go.

362
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.261
Here!

363
00:48:15.362 --> 00:48:18.031
4:32!
- Happy?
- Perfect!

364
00:48:19.166 --> 00:48:20.367
If you shave 2 seconds.

365
00:48:23.537 --> 00:48:28.542
Will?
Yes, madam’s.
It should be on her desk,
go check.

366
00:48:42.756 --> 00:48:44.625
Full inheritance to Wolly?

367
00:48:48.262 --> 00:48:49.363
Wait...

368
00:48:50.364 --> 00:48:55.402
Can she leave inheritance
to a dog?
Laws don’t allow leaving
inheritance to an animal.

369
00:48:55.736 --> 00:48:57.504
It will need a caretaker.

370
00:48:59.806 --> 00:49:02.776
CARETAKER: JUNG SU-YOUNG

371
00:49:03.243 --> 00:49:05.245
I’m designated as the caretaker.

372
00:49:05.546 --> 00:49:09.116
- Is that okay then?
- That’s the problem.

373
00:49:09.616 --> 00:49:15.989
Who’ll entrust redevelopment
to a dog caretaker?
You’re just a caretaker,
you don’t have any rights.

374
00:49:16.657 --> 00:49:20.661
- So what do I do?
- Let’s do it this way.

375
00:49:20.761 --> 00:49:31.004
Bring me her seal,
I’ll take care of the rest.
- Her seal?
- Yeah, let’s get things moving
under her name.
You should get rid of
the dog.

376
00:49:31.738 --> 00:49:40.881
- How can I just get rid of it?
- You’re no better than a dog,
will you die as a mutt walker?
Forget it!
I’ll take care of everything!

377
00:49:44.651 --> 00:49:45.619
What the heck!

378
00:49:49.489 --> 00:49:52.626
It’s gone...
Where did it go?

379
00:49:54.027 --> 00:49:56.163
He must have taken it.

380
00:49:58.999 --> 00:50:03.871
Mister!
You can’t take that...
Mister, don’t take that!

381
00:50:05.305 --> 00:50:09.776
What?
I know him,
he only has 3 fingers.

382
00:50:11.512 --> 00:50:15.415
So what do we do?
Where can we hide Wolly?

383
00:50:26.293 --> 00:50:28.662
Come on!

384
00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:32.266
Sis.

385
00:50:35.636 --> 00:50:40.140
- What?
- There is one place
to hide Wolly.
Where?

386
00:50:40.874 --> 00:50:44.011
You know, there.

387
00:50:44.912 --> 00:50:48.382
Right...
there.

388
00:51:09.303 --> 00:51:09.736
Here.

389
00:51:10.737 --> 00:51:14.508
Are you training me
like a mutt?!
We had to change our plan.

390
00:51:16.043 --> 00:51:22.516
I’ll get in trouble if it takes
more than 30 minutes!
If it takes more than 30,
my mom will kill me!

391
00:51:25.619 --> 00:51:26.987
Let’s begin.

392
00:51:39.499 --> 00:51:43.003
- Hello, did you make a reservation?
- Yes.

393
00:52:38.292 --> 00:52:39.259
Sweetie!

394
00:52:40.027 --> 00:52:42.763
Aren’t you ordering?
Your parents already did.

395
00:52:46.366 --> 00:52:56.543
Give me the best,
bloodiest steak.
And a bottle of the most
expensive wine here.
It’s their wedding anniversary.

396
00:53:21.635 --> 00:53:24.037
One, two, three!

397
00:54:08.048 --> 00:54:10.617
Where are you off to?

398
00:54:25.666 --> 00:54:29.870
It’s over.
Maybe he’s going to
the clinic early.

399
00:54:31.038 --> 00:54:44.618
Give it here.
- Hey!
- What?
Wait, that’s weird.
Why put him in the trunk?
Seal?
- You’re right.
- Oh right, in her office.
- Come on, go get it!
- Wait here.

400
00:54:57.998 --> 00:54:58.999
This button?

401
00:55:09.276 --> 00:55:11.011
Okay, I hear you.

402
00:55:11.245 --> 00:55:15.182
I’ll keep in touch,
just sit back and wait.
See you.

403
00:55:15.883 --> 00:55:16.917
Bye, Wolly!

404
00:55:37.137 --> 00:55:38.138
Here!

405
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:47.014
- Okay.
- As of now, we don’t know each other.
Keep your word.
Okay.
Don’t even come say hello.

406
00:55:56.123 --> 00:55:58.859
I thought he’d be
a fancy dog.

407
00:55:59.126 --> 00:56:03.630
Maybe even rich people
want ordinary things.

408
00:56:16.877 --> 00:56:17.511
Wow!

409
00:56:26.286 --> 00:56:27.788
YOON Su-oh?

410
00:56:45.138 --> 00:56:46.507
Su-young?

411
00:56:48.509 --> 00:56:50.110
Have you seen Wolly?

412
00:56:51.111 --> 00:56:55.282
Pardon?
Are you deaf?
Who unleashed Wolly?

413
00:56:55.883 --> 00:57:04.124
- Well... who could it be?
- I...
I saw Wolly going towards
the door earlier.

414
00:57:06.493 --> 00:57:08.295
Are you blind too?

415
00:57:09.129 --> 00:57:12.766
If you’re a bad manager,
be useful in something else!

416
00:57:21.275 --> 00:57:24.111
Don’t just stand there,
spread out and find him!

417
00:57:37.491 --> 00:57:38.625
Are you all right?

418
00:57:40.928 --> 00:57:41.862
Where’s Wolly?

419
00:57:42.629 --> 00:57:44.765
Well... not yet...

420
00:57:52.239 --> 00:57:56.543
Go downstairs.
- You should go to the hospital.
- I’m fine, go away.

421
00:58:04.117 --> 00:58:14.494
Should I...
make a report to the police?
Forget it.
Man or animal,
I won’t look for those who left.

422
00:58:15.796 --> 00:58:16.930
I see.

423
00:58:18.131 --> 00:58:19.499
As you wish.

424
00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:34.515
Yes, Mr. PARK.

425
00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:38.552
It’ll all work out,
just like you said.

426
00:58:39.386 --> 00:58:40.287
What?

427
00:58:43.557 --> 00:58:45.025
Wolly’s gone?

428
00:58:46.293 --> 00:58:50.430
What are you talking about?!
What if he suddenly pops up?

429
00:58:54.034 --> 00:58:56.904
Don’t just say it’ll be okay!

430
00:58:57.237 --> 00:58:58.238
What?

431
00:58:59.139 --> 00:59:00.040
Hello?

432
00:59:00.908 --> 00:59:02.009
Hello?

433
00:59:06.613 --> 00:59:09.116
We have to go,
mom’ll look for us.

434
00:59:09.116 --> 00:59:20.994
- Leave Wolly here alone?
- There’s no place better.
No one will find Wolly.
He’s safe from rain,
and he won’t stay long.

435
00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:25.265
Mom’s waiting!

436
00:59:26.033 --> 00:59:30.504
Wolly, hold on, okay?

437
00:59:30.537 --> 00:59:31.905
Promise.

438
00:59:32.239 --> 00:59:35.375
Flyers will be up tomorrow,
so don’t worry.

439
00:59:35.509 --> 00:59:37.744
Then he’ll head home.

440
00:59:50.924 --> 00:59:57.531
As I left him behind,
I saw a familiar look.

441
00:59:57.998 --> 01:00:03.804
It was my window reflection
when I first slept in the van.

442
01:00:04.371 --> 01:00:07.374
But that’s not important.

443
01:00:08.609 --> 01:00:16.116
The plan was perfect
and I’ll demand a $500 reward,
and I’ll buy a house.

444
01:00:16.517 --> 01:00:24.658
I’ll happily invite my friends
to my birthday,
and have a big party there.

445
01:00:40.541 --> 01:00:43.377
That’s... my dog!

446
01:00:48.115 --> 01:00:50.150
It’s mine!

447
01:00:52.619 --> 01:00:54.121
Fine, I hear you.

448
01:00:55.122 --> 01:00:57.758
Why did you
throw him away?

449
01:01:00.027 --> 01:01:04.431
I didn’t,
I’m just keeping it here.

450
01:01:09.736 --> 01:01:11.038
What’s his name?

451
01:01:12.306 --> 01:01:14.374
- Wolly.
- Wolly?

452
01:01:15.676 --> 01:01:18.178
So why do you
keep him here?

453
01:01:20.514 --> 01:01:21.515
It’s just...

454
01:01:24.751 --> 01:01:30.757
the landlord doesn’t allow pets.
Only till we move.

455
01:01:39.132 --> 01:01:41.735
Weird, that’s really weird.

456
01:01:43.871 --> 01:01:45.038
What is?

457
01:01:45.305 --> 01:01:48.375
When you become a landlord,
do you hate dogs,

458
01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:51.245
or when you hate dogs,
you become a landlord?

459
01:01:51.245 --> 01:01:53.013
Mister, did you sleep here?!

460
01:01:53.747 --> 01:01:55.749
You can’t sleep here!

461
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.485
Didn’t you see that?

462
01:01:59.119 --> 01:02:02.556
I saw,
that’s why I slept outside.

463
01:02:04.992 --> 01:02:13.667
Will you sleep here again?
Who knows,
I sleep wherever I feel like.
Why?
Don’t you have a house?

464
01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:20.007
Wherever I set my foot
is my house.

465
01:02:29.383 --> 01:02:31.485
Whoa,
what happened?

466
01:02:33.787 --> 01:02:36.123
That 3-finger man?

467
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:44.264
What do we do now?
Find Wolly’s rewards flyer.

468
01:02:55.008 --> 01:03:00.514
Maybe they got
a new dog.
That’s impossible.
Should we steal another?

469
01:03:02.516 --> 01:03:08.055
Should we go to Marcel?
No, I got private class.

470
01:03:20.667 --> 01:03:22.503
What? You saw Wolly?

471
01:03:23.871 --> 01:03:25.305
How do you know him?

472
01:03:25.806 --> 01:03:33.113
Answer me,
you never saw him before.
I did! When mom was fired!
From that window.

473
01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:37.417
So, where is he now?
Who knows?

474
01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:42.489
If you want,
I could find him for you.

475
01:03:43.257 --> 01:03:52.866
Thanks for your concern,
but she doesn’t want him now.
What?
- She doesn’t want Wolly?
- That’s right.

476
01:03:53.867 --> 01:03:58.038
Why?
Who knows?
Go away.
Now!

477
01:04:00.908 --> 01:04:02.543
Go back to your mom!

478
01:04:02.876 --> 01:04:07.014
And don’t come back.
You shouldn’t be here.
Go away!

479
01:04:07.548 --> 01:04:09.383
What happened to Wolly?

480
01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.389
Where did you see him?

481
01:04:17.558 --> 01:04:19.860
Front of my school.

482
01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.628
Was it really Wolly?

483
01:04:22.362 --> 01:04:24.000
Yes, I’m sure.

484
01:04:24.364 --> 01:04:25.632
His ears...

485
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.136
were like this,
and his mouth...

486
01:04:30.637 --> 01:04:31.738
was like this?

487
01:04:32.739 --> 01:04:40.013
Or this?
Anyway, you lost him, right?
I didn’t lose him,
he left home.

488
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:45.619
No, he could be lost!
He left with his own 4 feet!

489
01:04:46.653 --> 01:04:50.390
- In time, they all leave...
- You’re wrong!

490
01:04:54.628 --> 01:04:56.864
How would you know that?

491
01:04:58.999 --> 01:05:01.735
- It’s...
- How do you know?

492
01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:11.111
My dad’s lost too.

493
01:05:17.284 --> 01:05:22.256
- Did he leave home?
- No, he didn’t leave home...

494
01:05:22.389 --> 01:05:24.791
Well, he did...

495
01:05:24.892 --> 01:05:28.362
but I think he’s lost
and can’t find home.

496
01:05:28.529 --> 01:05:33.367
But one day,
he’ll find his way back.

497
01:05:34.501 --> 01:05:36.136
Same with Wolly.

498
01:05:37.804 --> 01:05:41.141
You really think so?
Yes.

499
01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:53.620
Then what should I do?
You must reach out!
By posting flyers.
Flyers?
Yes, that’s right.
With Wolly’s information.

500
01:05:54.888 --> 01:05:59.159
And reward...
Reward?

501
01:06:01.028 --> 01:06:02.663
How much would do?

502
01:06:05.132 --> 01:06:06.266
$500!

503
01:06:17.611 --> 01:06:22.249
- Hear that? Do what she says.
- What?

504
01:06:23.116 --> 01:06:24.885
Go on, do what she says.

505
01:06:26.553 --> 01:06:37.497
500 is too much
for a reward!
Of course not,
for someone who loves her dog,
they’d probably pay
10, 20 times more.

506
01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:40.868
That’s what gets me.

507
01:06:41.502 --> 01:06:44.137
Leaving inheritance to a dog...

508
01:06:45.372 --> 01:06:47.140
Here, your phone number.

509
01:07:04.391 --> 01:07:07.160
Here, make some copies.

510
01:07:09.263 --> 01:07:10.163
Happy?

511
01:07:12.032 --> 01:07:15.903
Since I came all the way,
could I get some ice cream?

512
01:07:16.503 --> 01:07:20.007
- What?
- And one for my brother too?

513
01:07:20.741 --> 01:07:23.777
You’re a clone of
your mom.

514
01:07:27.548 --> 01:07:29.416
Bring her two ice creams.

515
01:07:34.388 --> 01:07:36.156
What are you doing?

516
01:07:36.623 --> 01:07:38.859
I’m making a house for Wolly.

517
01:07:38.992 --> 01:07:43.530
Who asked you to do that?
You don’t want me
making it for him?

518
01:07:48.735 --> 01:07:50.237
Hold this.

519
01:07:55.175 --> 01:07:58.178
How much do
I have to pay you?

520
01:07:59.246 --> 01:08:00.013
What?

521
01:08:01.782 --> 01:08:04.284
How much will
this cost me?

522
01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.257
If I say I want a lot,

523
01:08:10.624 --> 01:08:12.993
would you give me that?

524
01:08:14.494 --> 01:08:16.029
You don’t have to, then.

525
01:08:16.496 --> 01:08:21.869
So you’re building it
for free?
Yeah, I’m like that.
I fix laundry machines,

526
01:08:23.003 --> 01:08:25.639
- fix bikes too.
- For free?

527
01:08:27.007 --> 01:08:27.875
Why?

528
01:08:30.878 --> 01:08:39.119
Because more than
I need money,
some people need
their problems solved right away.
No way.

529
01:08:40.287 --> 01:08:43.056
You couldn’t fix our van,
if it breaks.

530
01:08:43.757 --> 01:08:46.493
Only my dad can fix
the pizza van.

531
01:08:53.867 --> 01:08:57.638
When I was in the alley
off the main street,

532
01:08:57.871 --> 01:09:00.507
there was a flyer
for a lost dog.

533
01:09:02.109 --> 01:09:07.247
What?
It looked similar to your dog.

534
01:09:09.116 --> 01:09:12.000
Probably similar kind.

535
01:09:13.253 --> 01:09:14.388
Right?

536
01:09:14.621 --> 01:09:20.494
The funny thing is,
his name is also Wolly.

537
01:09:27.234 --> 01:09:29.736
“LOOKING FOR WOLLY”
We gotta take them back.
Why?

538
01:09:30.804 --> 01:09:35.242
3-finger man saw it.
We could get caught!

539
01:09:35.776 --> 01:09:39.179
It’s all over town,
how do we get them all?

540
01:09:41.515 --> 01:09:44.484
Yes, right away.

541
01:09:47.054 --> 01:09:47.754
Whoa!

542
01:09:49.056 --> 01:09:50.257
Dammit!

543
01:09:51.024 --> 01:09:52.759
I knew this’d happen!

544
01:10:16.116 --> 01:10:17.384
Do you know this man?

545
01:10:21.622 --> 01:10:24.892
He manages our assets,
something wrong?

546
01:10:25.626 --> 01:10:35.135
We’re after him
on a fraud charge.
Fraud?
We noticed that you sold this land
and property for redevelopment.

547
01:10:35.736 --> 01:10:37.304
Sold this property?

548
01:10:38.505 --> 01:10:45.012
Marcel?
You didn’t know?
He took off immediately
with the money.

549
01:10:45.245 --> 01:10:46.613
It was on the news.

550
01:10:48.916 --> 01:10:50.417
A huge sum.

551
01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:01.995
Like the job?

552
01:11:02.429 --> 01:11:03.664
Sure.

553
01:11:05.499 --> 01:11:08.735
I’ve never made lunch
for my kids.

554
01:11:09.303 --> 01:11:12.306
Feels weird to do it
for others.

555
01:11:34.361 --> 01:11:37.297
Yes, over here,
this way please.

556
01:12:19.006 --> 01:12:20.641
I don’t believe it.

557
01:12:50.737 --> 01:12:58.745
What is it?
Why are there
red stickers all over?
It’s nothing.
You lie.

558
01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:02.015
- What?
- You lied to me.

559
01:13:02.516 --> 01:13:03.617
What do you mean?

560
01:13:03.984 --> 01:13:06.887
You’ll be kicked out of here.

561
01:13:07.254 --> 01:13:12.359
I know, those stickers mean
you’ll be kicked out.

562
01:13:12.793 --> 01:13:16.663
They toss blankets
and stuff to the hallway,

563
01:13:16.864 --> 01:13:20.000
they shove you around,
things break...

564
01:13:20.133 --> 01:13:23.036
I lost my comb that way.

565
01:13:25.038 --> 01:13:28.041
Mom said that
it was no big deal too.

566
01:13:28.242 --> 01:13:37.784
You can’t get kicked out.
You shouldn’t live
in a car.
You don’t know how sad it is
to be homeless and live in a car.

567
01:13:42.756 --> 01:13:44.124
What’s your name?

568
01:13:44.758 --> 01:13:47.494
- I’m Ji-so.
- Ji-so...

569
01:13:47.995 --> 01:13:49.530
It’s a pretty name.

570
01:13:53.734 --> 01:14:01.508
Do you know
how much this is worth?
- How much?
- $250,000.

571
01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:12.119
The painter died in an accident
when he was only 30.
So there aren’t
many of his paintings.

572
01:14:12.419 --> 01:14:14.788
I’ve been collecting them.

573
01:14:15.889 --> 01:14:18.992
But I guess it’s time
to stop.

574
01:14:34.241 --> 01:14:35.742
YOON Su-oh?

575
01:14:37.511 --> 01:14:41.515
- Is he...
- He’s my son.

576
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:57.364
He loved to paint,
he wanted to be a painter.
I said I’ll never allow it.
So one day he left home.
Do you know what he said
before leaving?
He said he hated me
more than anything.

577
01:14:57.998 --> 01:15:06.740
And he never once called me
until his death.
When I went to collect his body,
When I went to collect his body,
a dog was guarding him.

578
01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.009
Was that...

579
01:15:09.676 --> 01:15:11.111
Wolly?

580
01:15:22.055 --> 01:15:24.491
Please! Please!

581
01:15:29.997 --> 01:15:31.365
Dang it!

582
01:15:34.635 --> 01:15:37.237
I think we have to
sleep here tonight.

583
01:15:38.872 --> 01:15:40.374
Sleep here?

584
01:15:41.508 --> 01:15:43.243
What if someone sees us?

585
01:15:47.881 --> 01:15:50.384
I know this is hard,
but be patient, okay?

586
01:15:50.751 --> 01:15:53.053
Always ‘patient’.
Another week?!

587
01:15:54.288 --> 01:16:00.494
Watch your mouth,
who am I doing this for?
Is this for me?
It’s for yourself!

588
01:16:00.928 --> 01:16:02.629
What did you just say?

589
01:16:04.264 --> 01:16:09.736
You told dad that
you were sick of him!
Isn’t that why
he left home?

590
01:16:12.906 --> 01:16:16.743
Always like this,
you’re never considerate!

591
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:26.787
Stubborn, always complaining,
and cranky!
- When will you grow up?!
- Look who’s talking!
- How could you
raise us here?!
- Hey! You brat!

592
01:16:31.391 --> 01:16:32.759
Dang it...

593
01:16:35.529 --> 01:16:40.234
If you left instead,
it wouldn’t be this bad.

594
01:16:56.984 --> 01:16:58.552
It’s really late...

595
01:17:01.989 --> 01:17:04.625
Why are you here?
Shouldn’t you be asleep?

596
01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:07.761
She and mom fought.

597
01:17:07.794 --> 01:17:08.795
Hey!

598
01:17:09.997 --> 01:17:11.164
It’s nothing.

599
01:17:19.239 --> 01:17:23.777
Your mom haven’t
found a house yet?

600
01:17:25.546 --> 01:17:29.750
Not yet.
But she’s trying.

601
01:17:34.988 --> 01:17:37.257
Why do you live
like this?

602
01:17:41.295 --> 01:17:43.297
What’s wrong with
how I live?

603
01:17:44.765 --> 01:17:47.234
No house, and no money.

604
01:17:49.903 --> 01:17:53.140
Wanna see something cool?

605
01:17:56.877 --> 01:18:00.414
Ever heard of Myanmar?

606
01:18:01.381 --> 01:18:07.754
I have.
There is a tribe called Moken.

607
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:15.128
They’re born on a boat,
and live on it until they die.

608
01:18:15.863 --> 01:18:24.371
They don’t have apartments, fridges, or cars,
they just go where the ocean takes them.

609
01:18:24.505 --> 01:18:26.240
I live my life like that.

610
01:18:28.509 --> 01:18:34.248
If you had a kid my age,
you couldn’t, right?
My daughter really loved that.

611
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:43.891
So why have you lived like this?
Don’t you miss her?
I miss her so much.

612
01:18:45.125 --> 01:18:47.261
Like you can’t even imagine.

613
01:18:47.995 --> 01:18:50.430
Then you can just go
see her.

614
01:18:52.366 --> 01:18:55.002
It’s shame,
I’m really ashamed.

615
01:18:55.369 --> 01:18:57.237
Ashamed of what?

616
01:19:02.042 --> 01:19:05.379
I was never good to her.

617
01:19:06.513 --> 01:19:13.987
When I really want to see her,
I watch her from afar.

618
01:19:20.494 --> 01:19:23.130
Would my dad do that too?

619
01:19:23.297 --> 01:19:27.501
Sure, all dads are the same.

620
01:19:42.783 --> 01:19:48.622
I bet Wolly wants to go home,
like we do.

621
01:19:49.156 --> 01:19:50.257
I know.

622
01:19:50.490 --> 01:19:55.629
I feel bad for Wolly,
like us.

623
01:19:55.996 --> 01:20:06.373
I know!
What’s wrong with you?
Don’t rub it in!
Wolly became like that
because of us.

624
01:20:08.509 --> 01:20:11.778
Wouldn’t mom worry about us?

625
01:20:12.746 --> 01:20:17.618
We’re heading back,
what’s wrong with you today?

626
01:20:21.889 --> 01:20:25.492
If we sell all the artworks
I own,

627
01:20:27.294 --> 01:20:29.429
we can at least save Marcel.

628
01:20:35.002 --> 01:20:38.305
Take over Marcel from tomorrow.

629
01:20:38.739 --> 01:20:40.007
What about you, madam?

630
01:20:53.153 --> 01:20:54.621
As you wish, madam!

631
01:21:15.509 --> 01:21:16.610
Hello?

632
01:21:17.177 --> 01:21:20.781
Will you really pay
$500 for Wolly?

633
01:21:21.281 --> 01:21:23.483
Yes, why?

634
01:21:24.751 --> 01:21:26.987
I know where he is.

635
01:21:42.803 --> 01:21:46.373
Sis, mom’s gone.

636
01:21:49.276 --> 01:21:52.513
- She’s probably around.
- Mom!

637
01:21:53.113 --> 01:21:58.652
- Mom! Mom!
- Be quiet!

638
01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:22.376
- Mom!
- You'll wake everyone up!
- What if she left us like dad?
- Hey!
- Mom left us because of you!
- Shut up!
Mom! Where are you?
Mom! Mom!

639
01:22:50.637 --> 01:22:57.744
I'LL MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT.
I'M SORRY I WASN'T
A GOOD FATHER AND HUSBAND.
JUST ONE WEEK.

640
01:23:03.016 --> 01:23:06.153
Be quiet! Stop that!

641
01:23:15.629 --> 01:23:21.134
Who said you could go out
at this hour!
How could you!

642
01:23:22.369 --> 01:23:23.737
Come here!

643
01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:31.512
You little brat!
Why are you so bad?
You uncontrollable!

644
01:23:31.879 --> 01:23:34.882
What will I do,
if you leave like that!

645
01:23:35.282 --> 01:23:39.887
I can’t go on
without you.

646
01:23:41.655 --> 01:23:46.426
Without you,
I’ll die...

647
01:23:48.762 --> 01:23:53.000
Sorry, mom.
It’s my fault.

648
01:23:54.168 --> 01:24:00.741
I’m sorry.
I’m sorry for raising you
in the van.

649
01:24:03.744 --> 01:24:10.284
Are we really living on here
because of my school?

650
01:24:12.553 --> 01:24:18.992
It’s dad, right?
So that he can find us,
isn’t that it?

651
01:24:26.733 --> 01:24:28.869
I miss dad.

652
01:24:29.236 --> 01:24:35.108
I hope he returns soon,
and turn things back to normal.

653
01:24:35.509 --> 01:24:40.113
I do too, sweetie.
I miss dad too.

654
01:24:43.884 --> 01:24:45.385
Ji-suk, come here.

655
01:24:46.486 --> 01:24:48.155
I’m sorry.

656
01:24:51.124 --> 01:24:56.763
I stole a dog.
I don’t know if that was
the perfect plan or not.

657
01:25:01.001 --> 01:25:04.638
But turns out, there was
more than achieving a goal.

658
01:25:05.906 --> 01:25:14.781
Living in a $500 deposit house,
or having my party there
as a goal,
could be dreadful.

659
01:25:21.555 --> 01:25:31.365
- What?
- Even if I continue living in a van,
will you stay friends with me?
- Yup! Of course!
- It’s fun playing with you.
Skipping classes too!

660
01:25:32.132 --> 01:25:36.370
But my mom caught me...

661
01:25:37.905 --> 01:25:49.183
I don’t want a party.
Really?
Yeah, we’ll take him
to Marcel’s front door.
As if he came back
for granny.

662
01:25:51.051 --> 01:25:54.121
That’s perfect!
Let’s do it!

663
01:25:58.792 --> 01:26:06.800
- Oh my goddess!
- What happened?
- Can’t you see?
- 3-finger man took off with Wolly.

664
01:26:07.501 --> 01:26:09.136
Wolly...

665
01:26:10.871 --> 01:26:17.544
Maybe he took him back
for the reward?
Or what if...
he ate him?

666
01:26:18.512 --> 01:26:19.613
No!

667
01:26:26.253 --> 01:26:28.555
- You thief!-
Where’s Wolly?

668
01:26:28.889 --> 01:26:32.759
- I was out looking for him.
- Did you eat him already?

669
01:26:36.663 --> 01:26:38.131
No!

670
01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.236
I didn’t eat him,
I didn’t do it!

671
01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.909
How many wheels do
I have?

672
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:52.379
Four.
But there’s only
1 track here.

673
01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.615
Who could it be?

674
01:26:57.551 --> 01:26:58.752
Thank you so much.

675
01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.622
Wolly, come here!

676
01:27:05.025 --> 01:27:08.762
Wait!
- And my $500?
- You’ll get it, so sit tight.

677
01:27:14.635 --> 01:27:16.870
So we did him a favor.

678
01:27:17.171 --> 01:27:19.873
But what matters is that
Wolly’s going home.

679
01:27:20.874 --> 01:27:23.744
But his home is the other way.

680
01:27:33.887 --> 01:27:34.888
There! I see him!

681
01:27:38.492 --> 01:27:42.296
Hurry, go after!
Step on it!

682
01:27:42.496 --> 01:27:44.131
Is this top speed?

683
01:27:44.364 --> 01:27:47.167
Walking would be faster!

684
01:27:49.236 --> 01:27:51.872
Children! Hold on tight!

685
01:28:02.049 --> 01:28:03.250
Out of the way!

686
01:28:07.654 --> 01:28:09.122
I’m sorry!

687
01:28:24.137 --> 01:28:27.875
There’s still 16km left.
That’s right.

688
01:28:29.243 --> 01:28:30.277
What’s that?

689
01:28:38.986 --> 01:28:40.420
Motorcycle, pull over.

690
01:28:40.621 --> 01:28:43.790
Pull over right now!
Children!

691
01:28:44.258 --> 01:28:46.260
Cops want us to stop!

692
01:28:46.527 --> 01:28:48.362
Pull over!

693
01:28:48.929 --> 01:28:50.297
Stop!

694
01:28:54.535 --> 01:28:55.502
Why you!

695
01:29:02.242 --> 01:29:03.410
Dammit!

696
01:29:10.384 --> 01:29:12.386
Wolly, sit!

697
01:29:24.765 --> 01:29:25.532
Hey!

698
01:29:26.166 --> 01:29:27.034
Hey!

699
01:29:28.135 --> 01:29:29.236
You bastard!

700
01:29:37.244 --> 01:29:38.178
Wolly?

701
01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:41.281
That mutt.

702
01:29:42.382 --> 01:29:43.984
When did you learn
to run so fast?

703
01:29:45.619 --> 01:29:47.554
Where is he?

704
01:29:51.859 --> 01:29:54.294
There, that car!
Over there!

705
01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:03.237
How could you let kids
ride in the back!

706
01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:07.374
Your ID please.
Give me your ID!

707
01:30:07.508 --> 01:30:12.779
Your ID.
Where you going?
Hey, come here!

708
01:30:21.488 --> 01:30:24.391
It’ll be over soon.
That’s good.

709
01:30:26.159 --> 01:30:27.628
It’s okay, it’s okay.

710
01:30:33.634 --> 01:30:45.245
- How dare you!
- What are you doing?
I have to take him
back to granny!
He’ll never return to Marcel!
- Give him to me!
- Let him go!

711
01:30:47.047 --> 01:30:48.549
Wolly!

712
01:30:53.053 --> 01:30:55.422
Wolly, come here boy!

713
01:30:55.556 --> 01:31:02.863
- Come here!
- Give him back!
- I got him!
- Here you are!
I’ve looked everywhere
for you.

714
01:31:03.163 --> 01:31:06.500
He kidnapped our puppy.

715
01:31:06.733 --> 01:31:08.235
That’s a lie!

716
01:31:09.002 --> 01:31:18.178
What's with you?
Drunk in broad daylight?
You drunk drove?
- Of course not.
- They took my dog!
- Why’d they steal a dog?
It’s my dog!

717
01:31:18.745 --> 01:31:20.380
Let’s go to the station.

718
01:31:21.014 --> 01:31:30.390
Stay put!
It’s my dog!
No, it’s not!
- You’re under arrest.
- Up yours!

719
01:31:46.006 --> 01:31:48.008
Thank you, mister.

720
01:31:48.609 --> 01:31:50.043
Wow!

721
01:31:50.611 --> 01:31:52.412
Mom bought a house?

722
01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.248
It’s nice.

723
01:31:59.253 --> 01:32:00.988
- Well...
- I’m off.

724
01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:04.391
Wait.

725
01:32:04.992 --> 01:32:06.627
Let me see here.

726
01:32:07.361 --> 01:32:08.662
I...

727
01:32:10.130 --> 01:32:12.633
found this on the ground.

728
01:32:14.134 --> 01:32:17.738
- This is...
- Bye!

729
01:32:19.306 --> 01:32:21.275
- Wait!
- What?

730
01:32:21.742 --> 01:32:27.548
Your daughter really misses you!
Like you can’t imagine.

731
01:32:49.303 --> 01:32:51.004
What do we do now?

732
01:32:54.541 --> 01:32:57.110
I’ll go in and drop him off.

733
01:32:57.377 --> 01:33:02.916
- I wanna go too, sis.
- No, it has to be done quietly.

734
01:33:03.617 --> 01:33:07.387
Good bye, Wolly.
So long, Wolly.

735
01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:26.373
Wolly, I’m sorry.

736
01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:32.880
I only thought of myself.
You need a home, like I do.

737
01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:34.381
I’m sorry.

738
01:33:35.549 --> 01:33:43.056
Someone’s waiting for you.
I hope the person
I’m waiting for returns soon.
Bye.

739
01:33:47.261 --> 01:33:50.764
You little.
So blinded by money!

740
01:33:51.365 --> 01:33:53.400
Your mom asked you to
do it?

741
01:33:54.635 --> 01:33:55.669
Of course not.

742
01:33:56.503 --> 01:33:58.505
What will you do with $500?

743
01:33:58.906 --> 01:34:05.679
Buy a house.
- Where in the world is a $500 house?
- There is!
- In Per Square.
- What?

744
01:34:07.114 --> 01:34:08.015
Here.

745
01:34:14.888 --> 01:34:19.359
This is per square meter.
Give him to me.

746
01:34:21.261 --> 01:34:22.262
Give it!

747
01:34:23.630 --> 01:34:24.865
Why you little!

748
01:34:26.366 --> 01:34:28.235
- No!
- Don’t move!

749
01:34:29.503 --> 01:34:32.873
- Don’t!
- Hold still!
No!

750
01:34:34.241 --> 01:34:37.177
-I fed you and cared for you!
- Wait!

751
01:34:37.778 --> 01:34:39.880
What are you doing?

752
01:34:45.385 --> 01:34:47.654
Wolly!

753
01:34:50.490 --> 01:34:53.126
I asked you a question.

754
01:34:56.163 --> 01:35:07.140
- I actually saw 1st draft of the will.
- What 1st draft?
You left the entire
inheritance to Wolly.
I’m your only bloodline!

755
01:35:07.407 --> 01:35:10.511
I’m no better
than a mutt?

756
01:35:11.545 --> 01:35:13.180
You’re unbelievable!

757
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:19.253
Are you here
because of my wealth?

758
01:35:25.759 --> 01:35:26.760
Out.

759
01:35:28.161 --> 01:35:33.166
Fine, I’ll leave!
- I don’t need to be treated this way!
- Off you go.

760
01:35:36.303 --> 01:35:38.138
That idiot...

761
01:35:50.884 --> 01:35:56.256
Thank you for
finding him.
You were right about
him not leaving.

762
01:35:56.557 --> 01:35:59.126
I’ll leave you now.

763
01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.995
Good bye.

764
01:36:15.542 --> 01:36:17.110
Were you lost?

765
01:36:23.016 --> 01:36:25.752
Went to see the world?

766
01:36:32.626 --> 01:36:38.432
He absolutely loves it
without the leash.

767
01:36:41.001 --> 01:36:42.536
How do you know that?

768
01:36:45.005 --> 01:36:46.039
Actually...

769
01:36:52.112 --> 01:36:56.116
Actually, I stole him.

770
01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:57.784
What?

771
01:36:58.886 --> 01:37:01.755
I stole Wolly.

772
01:37:18.238 --> 01:37:23.277
It was the most difficult task
of my life so far.

773
01:37:23.744 --> 01:37:27.614
I told granny everything.

774
01:37:28.515 --> 01:37:35.389
How dad left us one day,
how we were kicked out
of our home,

775
01:37:35.489 --> 01:37:38.659
the $500 house in Per Square

776
01:37:38.992 --> 01:37:43.931
and even having
a birthday party there.
I told her everything.

777
01:37:48.635 --> 01:37:54.741
When you experience hardships,
you're forced to do bad things.

778
01:37:55.108 --> 01:37:59.513
Even so,
what you did is terrible.

779
01:38:01.782 --> 01:38:03.984
Ji-so, nothing will change that.

780
01:38:05.619 --> 01:38:07.387
I’m sorry...

781
01:38:22.236 --> 01:38:24.638
I’ll be on my way.

782
01:38:54.368 --> 01:38:55.536
Kiddo!

783
01:38:59.506 --> 01:39:04.545
Could you walk him tomorrow?

784
01:39:08.282 --> 01:39:11.118
I’ll give you ice cream
in exchange.

785
01:39:47.788 --> 01:39:50.757
Sis, use this to buy our home.

786
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:26.260
What is that?
Open it.

787
01:40:27.361 --> 01:40:29.162
This is for Ji-so.

788
01:40:29.863 --> 01:40:33.367
And this is for Ji-suk.

789
01:40:35.802 --> 01:40:36.637
Wow!

790
01:40:53.921 --> 01:40:58.258
I’d never forget your birthday.

791
01:40:58.525 --> 01:41:00.761
I love you, honey.

792
01:41:02.996 --> 01:41:04.264
So pretty.

793
01:41:05.766 --> 01:41:09.503
Oh yeah! I’m gonna make
my own pizza tomorrow.

794
01:41:09.736 --> 01:41:11.004
Should we have
a pizza party?

795
01:41:11.672 --> 01:41:19.246
Mom, it’d be fun to have
pizza lunch box, right?
What a great idea!

796
01:41:27.754 --> 01:41:29.056
It stopped raining.

797
01:41:30.624 --> 01:41:34.995
Sweetie, gather the toiletries
with Ji-suk.

798
01:41:36.763 --> 01:41:37.764
Why?

799
01:41:38.131 --> 01:41:42.236
The van’s busted,
so we have to go to sauna today.

800
01:41:47.741 --> 01:41:51.512
What to do with this busted van?
Send it to junkyard?

801
01:41:51.879 --> 01:41:53.046
Junkyard?

802
01:41:54.515 --> 01:41:58.385
It won’t start,
and only dad can fix it.

803
01:42:04.491 --> 01:42:08.262
- Mom, try to start it.
- What?
Give it a try!

804
01:42:08.795 --> 01:42:13.000
Don’t kid around.
I’m not, just try it!

805
01:42:22.876 --> 01:42:23.744
Ji-so...

806
01:42:47.234 --> 01:42:50.671
- Should we still go to the sauna?
- Sure!

807
01:43:02.049 --> 01:43:06.987
Following Ji-suk’s idea,
mom made pizza lunch boxes,

808
01:43:07.254 --> 01:43:08.121
and it...

809
01:43:08.622 --> 01:43:10.424
became a big hit!

810
01:43:11.525 --> 01:43:14.628
- Here you go.
- Good luck to you!
Have a great meal!

811
01:43:14.761 --> 01:43:20.133
You forgot a fork.
The man who took
granny’s money was caught.

812
01:43:21.034 --> 01:43:24.738
So she didn’t have to sell
her house and paintings.

813
01:43:25.506 --> 01:43:29.376
And she bought
her son’s final painting.

814
01:43:37.384 --> 01:43:44.258
Nothing about Marcel changed.
Oh yeah, there is one!
I want my $500!

815
01:43:47.427 --> 01:43:51.632
When I asked her about
making a flyer for dad,

816
01:43:51.798 --> 01:44:03.277
- “Whatever.”
- she said.
All adults are the same.
“LOOKING FOR DAD”
All adults are the same.
“LOOKING FOR DAD”
Pride or whatever they call it.
DON’T BE SORRY,
WE’RE DOING GREAT.

817
01:44:23.530 --> 01:44:25.499
I still dream sometimes.

818
01:44:29.803 --> 01:44:34.308
In it, I live on the ocean
like the Moken tribe.

819
01:44:34.875 --> 01:44:38.612
And sometimes
Aesop comes for a chat.

820
01:44:39.179 --> 01:44:41.748
He’d ask me if I’m okay.

821
01:44:42.282 --> 01:44:45.285
I told him I was fine.
Then he said...

822
01:44:51.859 --> 01:44:52.759
Whatever!

823
01:45:44.244 --> 01:45:45.245
It’s this one!

824
01:45:48.015 --> 01:45:49.550
Tada!

825
01:45:50.250 --> 01:45:51.752
Wow!

826
01:45:52.986 --> 01:45:57.658
I came earlier
and decorated by myself.
You like it?

827
01:45:58.926 --> 01:46:03.764
There’s even a room for you two.
Here!
It’s huge!

828
01:46:05.365 --> 01:46:06.733
Go on in.

829
01:46:12.673 --> 01:46:16.777
I got a call from
Hanshin Real Estate.

830
01:46:17.010 --> 01:46:23.016
A granny’s renting out her son’s place
with only $500 house deposit!

831
01:46:23.483 --> 01:46:26.153
I didn’t know you could
get a house that cheap.

832
01:46:26.553 --> 01:46:30.257
Isn’t that weird?
Exactly $500!

833
01:46:44.171 --> 01:47:05.659
Square window,
spinning tire,
there’re many good things
about living in a van
With a single press,
the window rolls down,
ever so effortlessly

834
01:47:05.792 --> 01:47:13.901
But I prefer to
use my hand instead

835
01:47:16.503 --> 01:47:27.247
Breathing in the wind
through the window,
and realized
what’s important

836
01:47:27.247 --> 01:47:37.891
The living room I ran around in,
the cute bedI slept so comfortably in

837
01:47:37.891 --> 01:47:46.400
Watching TV with my family,
and even falling asleep on my desk...
