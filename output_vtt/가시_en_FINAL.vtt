00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.245
One

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.163
Two

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:25.377

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.719
Nine! Ten!

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.722
Before jumping in the pool,
shake your wrists.

00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:38.724
Shake right wrists 4 times.

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:41.727
One, two, three, four

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:43.812
Enter now from the last row.

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:46.732
Stop playing around.
Youll get hurt.

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:48.317
Next row.

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.242

00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:00.412
Attention!

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:03.790

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.695

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:37.407
Reverse! Two, three, four!

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:40.285
Roll your neck like this.

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:44.289
Reverse!

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.168
Whats that?

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.213
Why is she doing that?

00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:57.135
Come down!

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.554
Come down immediately!

00:02:58.554 --> 00:03:00.180
Come down now!

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.351
Stop playing around!

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.482
Oh, my goodness

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:11.817
Whats going on with her?

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.115
A crazy bitch

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.545
U okay?

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.203
Honey.

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.123
Honey.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.625
Yes!

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:53.126
What are you doing?

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.629
I was looking for something.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:57.631
I cant find them.

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:02.886
Where did it go?

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.472
Its gone. Where did it go?

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.599
You smoked.

00:05:08.392 --> 00:05:10.102
I didnt.

00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:13.772
You smell like cigarette.
You liar.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:16.733
By the way, why didnt you use
a moving and packing service?

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:19.236
Do you know how expensive it is?

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:29.913
Seo-yeon, wheres my uniform
and rugby ball?

00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.249
Why are you looking for them?

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.960
The match starts from next week.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.254
You broke your arms again last year.

00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:41.049
Im embarrassed if you wear a cast
when we have a family gathering.

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:42.885
I just want to watch the match.

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.180
Where did they possibly go?

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.684
Oh, here they are.

00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:57.983
Wow, they are washed and clean.

00:05:58.108 --> 00:05:59.943
Smells so fresh.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:02.154
- Just watch the game only!
- Without a doubt!

00:06:02.154 --> 00:06:05.324
I promise Ill just wear them
and watch the match.

00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:14.374
Why a dodge ball all the time?

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.919
I draw a line and pass a ball then

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.795
theyd play by themselves
for an hour.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:22.674
Let them play something else.
Mothers will make a great fuss.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.385
They played kicked ball before.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.306
Hows the new house?
Does Seo-yeon like it?

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:30.807
So so.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:33.018
Come to visit us some time
when you are free.

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.521
Pass me the ball.

00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:28.740
Are you okay?

00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:35.789
Your fingers might be broken
if you try to catch those balls.

00:07:36.415 --> 00:07:40.502
I am not afraid of anything.

00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:44.298
When I was your age,
I wasnt afraid of anything, either.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:51.513
What about now?
What are you afraid of?

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:54.808
Why should I tell you?

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.191
So that I can scare you.

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:08.614
Stop playing a joke on me, okay?

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:14.703
Done! You may leave!

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.628
Alright

00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:30.510
Hello.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:37.684
Hello.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:43.482
Thats hilarious.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.652
Get into the classroom, quickly!

00:08:46.652 --> 00:08:47.945
Get into the classroom, quickly!

00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:54.534
Real-estate or stock...
Not worth of investing these days.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:55.953
I see.

00:08:55.953 --> 00:08:59.748
Have you heard about shale gas?

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:03.293
Dad, I heard that business is
very promising.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:06.380
- Is that so?
- Yes

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.882
Ive got some source.
Do you want to join hand?

00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:10.884
I cant afford to do it.

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:14.304
I dont have much money
since I bought them an apartment.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.306
Did you finish unpacking?

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.184
It was easy, we used
a moving and packing service.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.645
Hows the work at school?

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:25.232
- Any difficulty?
- Not really...

00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:28.819
He knows that you put him in there,
so hell take care of it.

00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:30.153
Please just enjoy your dinner.

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:31.530
Alright

00:09:31.822 --> 00:09:33.407
Ill pay.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.742
Looks pretty.

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:38.453
My husband bought it for me
from a business trip.

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:41.999
Buy some expensive bags
like this too.

00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:44.293
Do you know how
important for ladies

00:09:44.293 --> 00:09:45.961
to wear expensive ones
as we get older?

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:48.672
Look at you.

00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:54.761
One Marlboro Light, please.

00:09:57.306 --> 00:10:00.934
Are you here to buy something?

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:02.936
Please buy me a strawberry milk.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.606
I should eat a lot
to recover from the injury.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.609
Ill pay all together.

00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:14.031
By the way,
why am I belongs to you?

00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:17.868
Three dollars, please.

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:24.917
Want to drink?

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:28.629
No, Im fine.
It looks like paint.

00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:32.549
- I like pink.
- Such a kid.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:40.766
- I heard you used to be a rugby player?
- Right

00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:43.060
I would like to learn too.

00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:47.564
Do you want me to hook you up?
Theres also a female team...

00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:28.605
Nice, nice.

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.232
You catch it.

00:11:30.232 --> 00:11:32.109
There you go. Nice.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.333
Yes he won!

00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:52.171
Youre having a dangerous taste
these days.

00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.172
What?

00:11:53.172 --> 00:11:54.714
You know it.

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:58.844
I saw her...
She looked like a doll.

00:11:58.969 --> 00:12:00.012
Stop it, dude.

00:12:00.012 --> 00:12:01.555
Hook me up with her friends.

00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:03.932
Just finish the shower.
You pervert.

00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:05.475
Im not a pervert.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:06.768
Stop teasing me.

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.270
So envy you.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.647
- Thank you.
- You know theres a match next week?

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.524
Take care of yourself.

00:12:38.634 --> 00:12:40.719
You may kiss me.

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:45.307
Fasten your belt, I meant.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.127
What are you doing?

00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:19.925
Marking a boundary.
Dont wash your car.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:27.182
Close the door.

00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:28.559
Get in.

00:13:29.268 --> 00:13:30.810
Get in!

00:13:40.237 --> 00:13:42.822
Dont make a space.

00:13:43.115 --> 00:13:45.242
Close the gap.

00:13:45.242 --> 00:13:46.910
Hurry up.

00:13:58.172 --> 00:13:59.673
Hurry up and lets go.

00:15:04.363 --> 00:15:07.407
They did quite well,

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.826
but I just wonder
how much they can move further.

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:13.121
Lets see how much Yonsei Univ.
can defend.

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:15.499
Yonseis strategy is
to continue offense

00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:19.002
by keeping on its winning streak.

00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:22.005
But Korea Univ. has a
strong defense strategy.

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:40.732
Where is it?

00:15:47.573 --> 00:15:51.451
Why are you toiling yourself late night?
Ill help you tomorrow.

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:54.954
Im fine.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.739
- What are you looking for?

00:16:28.739 --> 00:16:32.910
- Are you looking for this?
- Yes.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.288
- I look pretty?
- Sure.

00:16:36.288 --> 00:16:41.126
- Did you pick it at the school?
- I did.

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:44.630
- Ill wear it.
- As you want.

00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:41.186
Honey.

00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:43.689
Honey, wait.

00:17:46.942 --> 00:17:48.610
Honey.

00:17:55.284 --> 00:17:58.036
It seems too deep.

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:45.459
Hello?

00:18:45.876 --> 00:18:47.961
Oh, hi.

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:50.964
I called you a couple of times

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:52.966
for the water leaking
from the ceiling...

00:19:13.237 --> 00:19:14.655
Mr. Kim!

00:19:14.655 --> 00:19:17.324
Why are you still here?

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:21.954
I was going to run out,
but its raining too much.

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:25.666
I will go back home
when the rain stops.

00:19:30.921 --> 00:19:32.297
Are you cold?

00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:35.217
Yes, I am.

00:19:51.942 --> 00:19:54.111
Do you feel better now?

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:56.905
Is it delicious?

00:19:57.447 --> 00:20:00.576
I am just drinking it
because I am cold.

00:20:00.576 --> 00:20:02.536
You should drink
something else then.

00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:06.540
But no strawberry milk
in the vending machine.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.796
Arent you tired of it?

00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:18.385
When I am into one thing,
I only eat that one.

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:22.097
Hurry up drinking.
Youd better get going now.

00:20:23.974 --> 00:20:26.226
But its still raining.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.194
Itll stop soon.

00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:41.992
But Id like to be with you more.

00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:49.833
Ill scold you
if you keep acting up.

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:10.646
How do you think about me?

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:26.995
If you are done drinking,
just get up.

00:21:31.542 --> 00:21:33.377
I shouldve drank it slowly.

00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:42.970
You might catch a cold
change to this clothes.

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:50.310
Why? Does it smell sweat?

00:21:52.563 --> 00:21:54.773
It smells you.

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:57.860
Hurry up and change.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.326
What are you hesitating?

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.162
Should I enter alone?

00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:10.539
Then what?

00:22:12.457 --> 00:22:13.959
Im scared...

00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:17.671
You said you arent afraid of anything.

00:22:18.422 --> 00:22:20.382
Did I say Im afraid?

00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:22.301
I told you I am scared.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.985
Dont close the door, please.

00:22:40.194 --> 00:22:41.778
Im scared.

00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:06.011
Are you done?

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.847
But the zipper doesnt work.

00:23:09.348 --> 00:23:11.141
Try again.

00:23:11.975 --> 00:23:13.936
It seems broken.

00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:18.774
Hook the bottom part well,
then it will work.

00:23:20.984 --> 00:23:22.986
It still doesnt work.

00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:33.121
Try it again.

00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:36.416
I am telling you,
its not working.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.672
Try your best.

00:23:47.094 --> 00:23:49.096
Look!

00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:51.598
This zipper really does not work.

00:24:03.026 --> 00:24:05.279
Can you please do this for me?

00:24:44.193 --> 00:24:46.153
Ill head out now

00:24:47.487 --> 00:24:49.281
so you take your time.

00:25:05.339 --> 00:25:07.506
Please dont leave me alone.

00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:09.927
Im scared...

00:26:28.005 --> 00:26:29.798
Wait for me.

00:26:33.093 --> 00:26:34.678
Wait a minute.

00:27:22.518 --> 00:27:25.979
Your heart is racing.

00:27:26.104 --> 00:27:27.731
Just be quiet.

00:27:36.907 --> 00:27:38.700
Youre hurting me.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.708
It hurts.

00:27:47.417 --> 00:27:49.211
I told you it hurts.

00:27:49.545 --> 00:27:51.213
Be quite!

00:28:15.112 --> 00:28:16.905
Whos there?

00:28:20.742 --> 00:28:22.202
Is somebody there?

00:28:28.083 --> 00:28:29.751
Whos that?

00:28:32.171 --> 00:28:33.881
Whos that over there?

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.484
Young-eun.

00:28:55.986 --> 00:28:57.571
Young-eun.

00:28:57.988 --> 00:28:59.698
Young-eun.

00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:04.119
Young-eun.

00:29:09.875 --> 00:29:11.543
Young-eun.

00:29:15.005 --> 00:29:16.590
Young-eun.

00:29:38.904 --> 00:29:43.492
Everybodys off home.
He must have left...

00:29:44.034 --> 00:29:45.452
Wait a minute.

00:29:46.578 --> 00:29:48.080
Whos there?

00:29:50.707 --> 00:29:52.709
Oh, Mr. Kim.

00:29:53.001 --> 00:29:54.878
Havent you left the school yet?

00:29:55.045 --> 00:29:56.713
Yes.

00:29:58.882 --> 00:29:59.883
Hes here...

00:29:59.883 --> 00:30:01.800
Yes.

00:30:01.718 --> 00:30:03.095
Honey.

00:30:05.138 --> 00:30:06.431
Yeah...

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.069
Why didnt you
pick up the phone?

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.989
I didnt know you called me.
It was in the bag.

00:30:26.618 --> 00:30:28.495
It seems the rain stopped.

00:30:31.456 --> 00:30:32.749
Honey.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.336
Honey!

00:30:36.962 --> 00:30:38.755
Its stopped.

00:30:41.508 --> 00:30:45.095
I left something at school.

00:30:45.304 --> 00:30:46.221
Can you go ahead?

00:30:46.221 --> 00:30:48.182
I will grab it and go home.

00:30:49.766 --> 00:30:51.643
Lets go together, honey.

00:30:54.438 --> 00:30:56.023
Well...

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.858
Ill just pick it up later.

00:30:57.858 --> 00:30:59.484
Lets go.

00:31:05.324 --> 00:31:06.950
Honey.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:10.370
I inquired at the real-estate,
the internet and so on.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:15.959
They all say the upstairs people should pay
for the water leak from the ceiling.

00:31:17.794 --> 00:31:19.171
Honey.

00:31:20.172 --> 00:31:21.757
Honey.

00:33:35.265 --> 00:33:37.351
- Hello, Mr. Kim

00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:44.650
- Mr. Kim.

00:33:46.193 --> 00:33:47.277
Ju-hee.

00:33:47.277 --> 00:33:49.488
Is HA Young-eun absent today?

00:33:50.822 --> 00:33:53.617
Hey, have you seen Young-eun?

00:33:53.617 --> 00:33:54.826
Nope.

00:34:44.084 --> 00:34:45.752
Mr. Kim.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:52.092
What are you doing over there?

00:34:57.931 --> 00:34:59.433
Here you go.

00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:02.477
I am relieved.
I was looking for it.

00:35:05.189 --> 00:35:06.773
Are you okay?

00:35:10.194 --> 00:35:13.614
About what happened yesterday...

00:35:14.865 --> 00:35:16.617
I apologize you.

00:35:20.204 --> 00:35:21.955
I was scared.

00:35:23.081 --> 00:35:25.083
Why did you leave me alone?

00:35:27.211 --> 00:35:28.879
I actually came back soon.

00:35:31.048 --> 00:35:33.425
I shouldve waited for longer...

00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:37.429
About yesterday...

00:35:40.557 --> 00:35:42.851
Have you talked to anyone about it?

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.191
How can I tell people
about things like that?

00:35:51.652 --> 00:35:53.695
Young-eun, about yesterday...

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:57.449
Can it be a secret
between you and me?

00:36:01.912 --> 00:36:03.664
Two of us?

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.291
Yeah, two of us

00:36:09.044 --> 00:36:10.629
Two of us...

00:36:15.342 --> 00:36:16.760
Mr. Kim!

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:21.139
It is a secret
just between you and me...

00:36:26.103 --> 00:36:27.479
The secret is sealed.

00:36:45.205 --> 00:36:50.669
The teachers kiss was
sour and sweet

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.589
just like lemonade.

00:37:07.644 --> 00:37:12.441
When the thunder struck,
I happened to jump into his bosom.

00:37:13.984 --> 00:37:16.612
Just like the time he held me
when I fell into the pool,

00:37:16.612 --> 00:37:18.280
I was relieved.

00:37:45.224 --> 00:37:50.938
Soon his hands started
groping around my boops.

00:37:51.563 --> 00:37:57.361
Then soon they came into my body.

00:38:00.864 --> 00:38:08.580
His fingers in my body
were warm and firm.

00:38:20.175 --> 00:38:21.635
Be quite.

00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:23.929
It says they were warm and firm.

00:38:25.013 --> 00:38:26.098
You, whats that?

00:38:26.098 --> 00:38:28.225
This is damn funny.

00:38:28.225 --> 00:38:29.685
Unbelievable.

00:38:32.938 --> 00:38:34.731
It is shocking.

00:38:35.566 --> 00:38:36.942
What are they doing?

00:38:37.234 --> 00:38:38.902
Arent they watching a porno?

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.076
Whats up?

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:47.661
What are you doing?

00:38:51.582 --> 00:38:53.125
Step aside

00:39:07.514 --> 00:39:09.516
Online diary...

00:39:10.475 --> 00:39:11.977
Did you write the diary?

00:39:13.353 --> 00:39:14.730
Yes.

00:39:15.856 --> 00:39:17.649
Is it all true?

00:39:17.649 --> 00:39:18.942
What do you mean?

00:39:19.443 --> 00:39:21.653
Mr. Kim, I mean...

00:39:22.779 --> 00:39:29.912
Did some teacher do that to you?

00:39:31.163 --> 00:39:33.332
What does it mean
doing that to me?

00:39:36.835 --> 00:39:38.170
I mean...

00:39:41.173 --> 00:39:44.259
Your body...

00:39:45.886 --> 00:39:47.387
He touched it...

00:39:48.013 --> 00:39:51.475
Did he really do that to you?

00:40:05.948 --> 00:40:07.533
Its only a fiction.

00:40:11.537 --> 00:40:14.623
So you just made it up?

00:40:16.208 --> 00:40:17.668
Yes.

00:40:18.502 --> 00:40:21.171
I am not suspicious of you, Mr. Kim.

00:40:24.049 --> 00:40:25.926
But its just the nature of this school.

00:40:28.136 --> 00:40:32.599
Kids grow only in this town
from kindergarten to high school.

00:40:33.225 --> 00:40:35.352
So they are quite naive.

00:40:35.352 --> 00:40:38.188
Their standard of living is
similar to each other.

00:40:38.188 --> 00:40:41.066
There are no cheeky students
in this school.

00:40:41.275 --> 00:40:44.903
So their parents keep watching
the school carefully.

00:40:44.903 --> 00:40:47.531
Even if you are clean,

00:40:47.531 --> 00:40:50.448
the school has to
take an action against you.

00:40:51.702 --> 00:40:54.037
You should behave yourself
in every situation from now on.

00:40:54.955 --> 00:40:58.625
No more rumors
about you and student.

00:40:59.376 --> 00:41:00.961
Arent you embarrassed?

00:41:01.253 --> 00:41:02.838
Dont you know any shame
at your age?

00:41:02.838 --> 00:41:03.839
Why are you mad at me?

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:06.341
What on earth
did you write the story?

00:41:06.341 --> 00:41:08.218
Why did you write it?

00:41:09.928 --> 00:41:11.847
So that I wouldnt forget about it.

00:41:12.264 --> 00:41:13.265
Its not even a lie.

00:41:13.348 --> 00:41:15.726
I know its not a lie.
Its a real story.

00:41:19.646 --> 00:41:21.648
Now you are driving me crazy!

00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:28.030
You look like a stranger.

00:41:34.203 --> 00:41:35.287
Catch the ball.

00:41:35.287 --> 00:41:36.872
Go catch!

00:41:39.041 --> 00:41:41.251
You shouldve given the penalty
to that team, but not to us!

00:41:41.251 --> 00:41:42.920
Are you blind?

00:41:45.422 --> 00:41:46.840
Here!

00:41:47.591 --> 00:41:49.051
Catch it.

00:42:00.979 --> 00:42:02.648
Jun-gi.

00:42:02.648 --> 00:42:04.149
Are you having an affair?

00:42:04.149 --> 00:42:05.692
What do you mean?

00:42:05.692 --> 00:42:07.486
Whos Strawberry Milk?

00:42:09.071 --> 00:42:11.907
She texted you 10 times.

00:42:13.325 --> 00:42:15.160
It says shes waiting for you
at the rooftop.

00:42:26.004 --> 00:42:28.674
Finished already? Heres more.

00:42:31.552 --> 00:42:34.054
By the way,
Hyung-seok quit the job?

00:42:34.179 --> 00:42:35.222
He did.

00:42:35.305 --> 00:42:37.057
Then theres a coach vacancy,
isnt it?

00:42:37.224 --> 00:42:39.434
Why? Do you want the job?

00:42:39.434 --> 00:42:43.647
I wanna cut out
this teaching job. Shit!

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.024
Nuts to you!

00:42:46.024 --> 00:42:49.319
Dude, where can you find a job
like a teacher?

00:42:49.361 --> 00:42:51.989
Banks give you a low interest.

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.115
And when your children are growing,

00:42:53.115 --> 00:42:55.200
do you know
how much they spend money?

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.619
And you are going to
have the second baby.

00:42:57.619 --> 00:43:00.038
The baby is the first one,
you idiot.

00:43:00.038 --> 00:43:02.165
You blockhead!

00:43:02.666 --> 00:43:05.085
Why is it the first one?

00:43:05.586 --> 00:43:08.380
Didnt you get married
because you knocked up your wife?

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.007
You quit playing
when you were on a roll,

00:43:10.007 --> 00:43:13.010
so the team made fuss about it.

00:43:13.343 --> 00:43:15.304
I have a behind story.

00:43:16.054 --> 00:43:17.514
None of your business.

00:43:22.186 --> 00:43:24.062
Pick up the phone, you bastard.



00:44:00.974 --> 00:44:03.268
I set the table for you, so eat.

00:44:19.535 --> 00:44:22.913
If the secretary calls,
tell him to look out for a new one.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.541
Ill only work until the
end of this month...

00:44:46.937 --> 00:44:48.730
This supermarket is too expensive.

00:44:52.192 --> 00:44:55.779
Honey, I started a tutoring job.

00:44:56.947 --> 00:44:59.157
How can you teach
in that condition?

00:44:59.575 --> 00:45:01.159
Any job is helpful for us.

00:45:01.827 --> 00:45:04.329
It takes a lot of money
to raise a child.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:11.712
Honey, are you done shopping?

00:45:14.298 --> 00:45:15.549
Lets go to a wholesale instead.

00:45:15.841 --> 00:45:17.426
Okay.

00:45:33.817 --> 00:45:35.277
Hello.

00:45:36.945 --> 00:45:38.736
Hello.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.742
Mr. Kim.

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:47.164
Mr. Kim.

00:45:48.999 --> 00:45:50.748
I miss you...

00:46:29.581 --> 00:46:31.959
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.796
I envy you, Mr. Kim.

00:46:39.132 --> 00:46:41.134
You are so popular.

00:47:07.411 --> 00:47:09.037
Honey, I am back.

00:47:09.037 --> 00:47:10.414
Are you?

00:47:10.747 --> 00:47:12.040
You must be hungry.

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.418
Yeah, my throat is dry.

00:47:14.459 --> 00:47:17.212
I will cook something tasty.

00:47:20.591 --> 00:47:22.259
- Wait a second.
- Why?

00:47:22.301 --> 00:47:24.261
I want to show you something.

00:47:24.303 --> 00:47:25.762
But I am starving.

00:47:25.762 --> 00:47:27.472
Just one second.

00:47:27.472 --> 00:47:28.974
What is it?

00:47:29.641 --> 00:47:31.310
Ta-da!

00:47:32.936 --> 00:47:34.396
Hey presto!

00:47:35.439 --> 00:47:36.815
So cute, huh?

00:47:37.357 --> 00:47:39.151
Seo-yeon, what are all these?

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:43.155
It was possible because of the girl.

00:47:51.914 --> 00:47:53.373
Welcome.

00:47:57.836 --> 00:47:59.796
I didnt know
she was your student.

00:47:59.796 --> 00:48:01.340
This isnt a coincidence
that we met.

00:48:09.348 --> 00:48:12.100
I think hes feeling uncomfortable
around me.

00:48:14.561 --> 00:48:16.438
No, he isnt.

00:48:29.993 --> 00:48:31.662
The soup is tasty.

00:48:31.787 --> 00:48:33.580
Do you want some more?

00:48:33.747 --> 00:48:35.040
Yes, Mam.

00:48:57.563 --> 00:48:59.773
- Thank you.
- Help yourself.

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.778
I will sleep over here.

00:49:07.322 --> 00:49:09.116
Tell her to sleep over.

00:49:09.366 --> 00:49:12.035
She said her parents are out
for ancestral rite.

00:49:13.453 --> 00:49:15.247
She will scared left alone at home.

00:49:17.249 --> 00:49:18.584
Please?

00:49:46.445 --> 00:49:48.989
When we listen to Bach,
youll have good memory.

00:49:52.743 --> 00:49:54.036
Seo-yeon...

00:49:54.036 --> 00:49:55.329
Why?

00:49:55.996 --> 00:49:57.414
Young-eun...

00:49:57.414 --> 00:50:00.292
Yeah, shes so pretty.

00:50:01.126 --> 00:50:03.879
I wish I could give a birth
to a daughter like her.

00:50:05.923 --> 00:50:07.424
Youd better stop the tutoring.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.011
How come?

00:50:11.762 --> 00:50:14.848
Just quit it.
I dont feel comfortable.

00:50:16.391 --> 00:50:19.269
But I already received
the tuition fee.

00:50:22.314 --> 00:50:24.816
Why dont you just return it?

00:50:26.235 --> 00:50:29.404
I already bought some medicine
for your mother.

00:50:34.284 --> 00:50:35.953
Young-eun...

00:50:38.163 --> 00:50:40.040
She likes me.

00:50:49.007 --> 00:50:50.926
Kids at that age
have a thing on a teacher.

00:51:40.726 --> 00:51:42.227
Are you crazy?

00:51:44.563 --> 00:51:46.732
Dont do it.
Shell soon wake up.

00:51:51.278 --> 00:51:52.654
What are you up to?

00:51:52.779 --> 00:51:54.489
Stop playing.

00:51:55.407 --> 00:51:56.909
I said stop it.

00:51:56.909 --> 00:51:58.493
Is it because I am poor at this?

00:51:58.827 --> 00:52:00.245
I will try my best.

00:52:03.415 --> 00:52:05.167
Young-eun, Young-eun!

00:52:08.295 --> 00:52:11.006
Guys like these things.

00:52:11.006 --> 00:52:12.799
Stop it.

00:52:14.927 --> 00:52:16.512
Young-eun!

00:52:20.265 --> 00:52:21.642
Dont do it!

00:52:25.479 --> 00:52:28.649
Honey!

00:52:50.546 --> 00:52:52.548
The baby due is coming soon.

00:52:52.548 --> 00:52:54.508
Yes, 2 weeks left.

00:52:54.633 --> 00:52:57.719
Does your school know
about Young-eun?

00:52:58.846 --> 00:53:00.097
Huh?

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:02.015
About the tutoring...

00:53:02.015 --> 00:53:04.226
I am worried if he would be
in a trouble.

00:53:04.226 --> 00:53:06.979
Its a bit strange that
he wants me to stop teaching.

00:53:07.938 --> 00:53:11.024
It wouldnt do any good to him.

00:53:11.567 --> 00:53:13.944
The principal is also walking on eggshells
around Young-eun?

00:53:14.152 --> 00:53:17.281
I heard she is a secret child
of a CEO of a large company.

00:53:17.656 --> 00:53:21.702
How do you know about it?
The thing moves very fast.

00:53:21.702 --> 00:53:24.371
People here gossip a lot.

00:53:26.665 --> 00:53:28.667
Now you know
how to compress the chest.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.002
Yes.

00:53:30.085 --> 00:53:32.754
Ill show you a demonstration.

00:53:32.838 --> 00:53:34.006
Who wants to volunteer?

00:53:34.089 --> 00:53:37.801
Me!

00:53:42.181 --> 00:53:43.932
Ju-hee, come out.

00:53:44.349 --> 00:53:45.976
What?

00:53:46.518 --> 00:53:47.811
What is he doing?

00:53:47.811 --> 00:53:49.271
Be quiet, everyone!

00:53:49.688 --> 00:53:51.064
Lower your leg a bit and

00:53:51.899 --> 00:53:56.403
hold the forehead as I told you,
then hold the chin.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:58.572
Where did I tell you to look at?
Look at the chest.

00:53:58.655 --> 00:53:59.323
Yes.

00:53:59.364 --> 00:54:01.200
Look at your bosom at
where you are.

00:54:06.205 --> 00:54:08.332
Quite down! Be quite!

00:54:08.332 --> 00:54:09.833
Ju-hee, go back to your place.

00:54:09.833 --> 00:54:11.710
Stop playing during class.

00:54:13.545 --> 00:54:15.672
- Did I make myself clear?
- Yes.

00:54:15.672 --> 00:54:17.341
Then lets practice now.

00:54:20.385 --> 00:54:22.596
Was it really good?
You loved it?

00:54:22.596 --> 00:54:24.181
Get back to your senses.

00:54:24.223 --> 00:54:27.267
How do you feel that
you kissed the PE teacher?

00:54:27.392 --> 00:54:29.186
It was my first kiss.

00:54:29.353 --> 00:54:32.439
Bullshit! How many times
have you done the first kiss?

00:54:32.564 --> 00:54:34.608
So how did you like it?

00:54:34.691 --> 00:54:37.444
I dont know.
I dont remember anything.

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.660
Whos that?

00:54:45.452 --> 00:54:47.829
Who are you? Dont play with me.

00:54:52.042 --> 00:54:53.502
Who is that?

00:55:01.051 --> 00:55:02.094
How could this possibly happen?

00:55:02.261 --> 00:55:04.555
How in the world did you do
the student management

00:55:04.638 --> 00:55:08.600
a student brought a knife
and committed the tedious accident?

00:55:08.725 --> 00:55:09.768
What are you going to do
with my daughter?

00:55:09.852 --> 00:55:12.938
Look at her face!
What are you going to do, Mr. Kim?

00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:20.612
Please understand her
shes just upset.

00:55:20.779 --> 00:55:22.447
But they said
it wouldnt leave a scar.

00:55:23.282 --> 00:55:24.950
It happened in the female shower.

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:26.493
Theres nothing you could do
at that time.

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:29.371
School wants to drop
the other shoe quietly.

00:55:29.913 --> 00:55:31.957
I shouldve not called out Ju-hee.

00:55:33.125 --> 00:55:35.127
So you think Young-eun did it?

00:55:40.757 --> 00:55:42.009
Its not Young-eun.

00:55:42.467 --> 00:55:44.178
There is a girl who took
a shower with her.

00:55:46.138 --> 00:55:47.389
Did you know about it?

00:55:47.973 --> 00:55:49.516
Since from when on earth?

00:55:50.142 --> 00:55:53.395
All the stories on the online board...
Are they all real?

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.197
Come to your senses.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.490
- Where are we?
- We are at home.

00:56:05.616 --> 00:56:07.367
- Home?
- Lets go.

00:56:07.492 --> 00:56:12.623
Min-ju, Im sorry...

00:56:26.011 --> 00:56:28.680
- Pick up the phone...
- Hey, what are you touching?

00:56:30.682 --> 00:56:32.184
Please come around.

00:56:32.267 --> 00:56:34.520
I feel... like to die.
Im not kidding.

00:56:41.068 --> 00:56:43.487
We had an accident at school.

00:56:43.487 --> 00:56:44.988
Did you two drink?

00:56:44.988 --> 00:56:48.033
No, with teachers at school.

00:56:48.367 --> 00:56:49.868
Were almost there.

00:56:55.916 --> 00:56:57.835
Why didnt you stop him?

00:56:58.043 --> 00:57:00.254
Did you just leave him
get dead drunk?

00:57:04.716 --> 00:57:06.093
Lie down.

00:57:08.053 --> 00:57:09.429
What are you doing there?

00:57:10.639 --> 00:57:12.015
Its already late.

00:57:13.141 --> 00:57:15.102
Youre right.

00:57:15.227 --> 00:57:16.645
Im off now.

00:57:30.117 --> 00:57:31.618
Thank you,

00:57:32.744 --> 00:57:34.121
for lying-

00:57:35.956 --> 00:57:38.458
There are many people
who saw two of you together.

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:44.173
- Just in case that you misinterpret it.
- I dont misinterpret.

00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:47.968
You and my husband are old friends.
Thats howl understand.

00:57:51.096 --> 00:57:52.723
I agree. Im sorry.

00:57:53.056 --> 00:57:54.600
Its late Id better be off.

00:57:57.769 --> 00:57:59.313
People gossip a lot in this town.

00:58:00.397 --> 00:58:01.690
Please be careful.

00:58:05.027 --> 00:58:06.195
Im begging you.

00:58:24.296 --> 00:58:29.301
When P, H, and P
are well combined,

00:58:30.802 --> 00:58:33.013
youll see more than
2 of linear relations.

00:58:37.559 --> 00:58:38.810
Do you like it?

00:58:39.144 --> 00:58:40.729
I want to try it on.

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:44.274
But people dont take off
a wedding ring for good.

00:58:45.192 --> 00:58:47.194
I saw you taking it off
when you did the laundry.

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.989
Alright! Just once.

00:58:53.659 --> 00:58:55.619
My fingers seem swollen
that it wouldnt take off.

00:59:02.125 --> 00:59:03.877
Take time...Slowly...

00:59:14.555 --> 00:59:16.557
I guess you like somebody?

00:59:17.724 --> 00:59:19.226
I actually love somebody.

00:59:20.269 --> 00:59:21.854
Its not like?

00:59:22.771 --> 00:59:24.523
How much do you love him?

00:59:27.609 --> 00:59:32.072
As much as I can cut my one leg
to give it to him.

00:59:39.997 --> 00:59:41.748
Who would like to receive that?

00:59:48.881 --> 00:59:51.884
How much do you love Mr. Kim?

00:59:58.724 --> 00:59:59.975
Let me see...

01:00:00.642 --> 01:00:06.648
Can you cut your
one finger for him?

01:00:14.656 --> 01:00:16.408
Times up.

01:00:16.658 --> 01:00:18.243
Lets call it a day.

01:00:26.752 --> 01:00:28.212
You may leave.

01:00:29.046 --> 01:00:30.589
Ill leave when
Mr. Kims back home.

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:33.759
Why? Do you have something
to talk to him?

01:00:33.759 --> 01:00:35.427
I will tell him.

01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:39.636
Its a secret...

01:00:40.599 --> 01:00:41.892
between him and me.

01:00:44.811 --> 01:00:46.188
Is that so?

01:00:46.605 --> 01:00:48.106
Hes here!

01:00:51.777 --> 01:00:53.320
Youre home.

01:00:54.571 --> 01:00:57.824
Why are you so late?
I have waited for you so long.

01:00:58.992 --> 01:01:00.410
Hand it to me.

01:01:01.036 --> 01:01:02.621
Honey, Im home.

01:01:03.038 --> 01:01:03.914
Youre back.

01:01:03.956 --> 01:01:05.624
Ill change my clothes.

01:02:09.855 --> 01:02:11.440
Dinners ready, honey.

01:02:11.523 --> 01:02:13.400
Youre going to be late.

01:02:45.224 --> 01:02:47.100
The lid wouldnt open.

01:04:00.257 --> 01:04:01.633
Lets stop this.

01:04:03.594 --> 01:04:04.970
Why?

01:04:06.597 --> 01:04:08.640
You are afraid of me
to tell her about us?

01:04:12.311 --> 01:04:15.189
I am not going to,
so dont worry.

01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:20.319
Then your wife wouldnt
let me in your house.

01:04:22.362 --> 01:04:23.739
Young-eun,

01:04:27.159 --> 01:04:29.661
I cant cheat on my wife anymore.

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:36.877
Then, should I tell her everything?

01:05:15.624 --> 01:05:17.209
Honey, are you sleeping?

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.419
No.

01:05:21.755 --> 01:05:23.924
Im thinking I might quit school.

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:39.231
Honey.

01:05:40.899 --> 01:05:41.942
Honey!

01:05:59.251 --> 01:06:01.128
It pays less than school but...

01:06:04.006 --> 01:06:05.465
I found a coaching position.

01:06:07.009 --> 01:06:08.093
Coach?

01:06:09.761 --> 01:06:10.762
Yes.

01:06:13.932 --> 01:06:15.434
Coaching job sounds only nice.

01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:19.646
But isnt it just a part-time job
and you can be fired at any time?

01:06:21.273 --> 01:06:23.150
Im confident I can do it well.

01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:26.153
Coaching job suits me.

01:06:29.031 --> 01:06:31.074
We are going to be parents soon.

01:06:31.783 --> 01:06:34.620
We cannot afford to live
for the talent of your own.

01:06:35.245 --> 01:06:36.246
Seo-yeon,

01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:41.752
this is not about
the matter of my talent.

01:06:45.047 --> 01:06:46.632
Then just bear with
the teaching job.

01:06:47.508 --> 01:06:49.134
For the sake of our baby.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.225
I have something to tell you.

01:07:04.149 --> 01:07:05.984
You wont be able to handle this.

01:07:06.318 --> 01:07:07.528
Its too late.

01:07:07.861 --> 01:07:10.113
I dont want to listen to something
I cant handle.

01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:42.354
Are you really going to
quit tutoring?

01:07:43.397 --> 01:07:45.190
Its tough that my due date
is coming soon.

01:07:52.072 --> 01:07:54.074
I can take care of a baby well.

01:07:54.449 --> 01:07:56.118
But its tough for me.

01:08:00.414 --> 01:08:01.957
Whats the smell?

01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:04.418
Beef leg bone broth.

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:07.921
Do you want some?

01:08:25.522 --> 01:08:26.607
Are you okay?

01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:33.363
I am pregnant.

01:08:35.449 --> 01:08:36.450
What?

01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:23.695
I feel like I am
riding on a ride.

01:13:24.738 --> 01:13:26.156
Lets do it one more time.

01:13:27.157 --> 01:13:28.404
Arent you scared?

01:13:29.409 --> 01:13:30.536
Why am I scared?

01:13:33.205 --> 01:13:34.873
What if I push you?

01:13:35.832 --> 01:13:37.876
Why would you push me?

01:13:49.805 --> 01:13:51.223
Please forgive me.

01:13:52.724 --> 01:13:53.976
Forgive you for what?

01:13:55.644 --> 01:13:57.604
I have a wife.

01:14:01.525 --> 01:14:02.818
I know.

01:14:03.235 --> 01:14:04.736
I will forgive you.

01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:07.781
Ill have a child soon.

01:14:08.615 --> 01:14:10.200
I know that too.

01:14:11.076 --> 01:14:12.870
I will forgive you.

01:14:15.747 --> 01:14:17.040
I love you.

01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:29.052
I adore you.

01:14:40.355 --> 01:14:41.940
Whats the matter?

01:14:44.818 --> 01:14:47.404
So is everything going to be okay
only if your wife is not around?

01:15:34.201 --> 01:15:35.536
Mr. Kim.

01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:40.374
Mr. Kim.

01:16:00.853 --> 01:16:01.854
Isnt it pretty?

01:16:02.521 --> 01:16:04.560
I remember those time.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.526
He shivered his hands so much

01:16:08.861 --> 01:16:10.863
it took him a while
to put the ring on me.

01:16:12.114 --> 01:16:13.991
Perhaps, he didnt want to
put it on you.

01:16:17.536 --> 01:16:18.662
Is that so?

01:16:21.206 --> 01:16:25.002
Anyways, I am wearing this ring
on my finger.

01:16:26.378 --> 01:16:30.340
That looks like hand-cuffs,

01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:34.428
that you wont be able to
move at all.

01:16:40.559 --> 01:16:42.561
Maybe he wants the baby
for that reason?

01:16:52.029 --> 01:16:56.241
These days, Mr. Kim looks different
from these pictures.

01:16:58.368 --> 01:17:00.162
It seems he needs love.

01:17:00.954 --> 01:17:03.165
You know, married couples
live by more than love itself.

01:17:06.084 --> 01:17:10.881
Marriage is a whole lot different
from romantic feelings.

01:17:12.382 --> 01:17:15.219
I dont need more than love.

01:17:15.886 --> 01:17:17.471
He didnt promise you for anything

01:17:17.471 --> 01:17:18.805
and he is not responsible for you.

01:17:19.932 --> 01:17:22.100
Without a ring,
not spending any money?

01:17:27.773 --> 01:17:31.068
He would thank to you!
For you were easy to play with.

01:17:37.074 --> 01:17:38.909
You were only a toy to him.

01:17:39.576 --> 01:17:40.656
Its love.

01:17:40.619 --> 01:17:41.912
Do you date at all?

01:17:42.412 --> 01:17:44.414
Does he kiss on you
when he sends you off?

01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:46.662
How many times does
he call you a day?

01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:48.627
Doesnt he happen to
pick up your phone?

01:17:49.169 --> 01:17:50.754
Hes probably fed up with you.

01:17:50.879 --> 01:17:52.798
- No, hes not.
- Why do you deny?

01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:54.550
Its time to leave him
for hes fed up with you.

01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:56.718
Hes only fed up with
these pictures.

01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:59.680
Just go away from him!

01:18:18.407 --> 01:18:19.825
How was it.
When you slept with him?

01:18:21.702 --> 01:18:22.828
Did you enjoy?

01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:32.629
Of course.

01:18:40.721 --> 01:18:42.306
How did he touch you?

01:18:48.228 --> 01:18:49.479
Did you feel him?

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:08.123
Are you really curious?

01:19:13.045 --> 01:19:14.630
How should I start the story...

01:19:21.053 --> 01:19:25.224
I was startled at first.

01:19:27.267 --> 01:19:28.764
It hurt much

01:19:31.647 --> 01:19:36.151
because he grabbed
my bosom tight

01:19:37.861 --> 01:19:38.987
like this.

01:19:45.202 --> 01:19:46.370
And then?

01:19:48.705 --> 01:19:54.086
Then slowly

01:19:55.003 --> 01:19:56.380
he moved his hands down.

01:19:59.299 --> 01:20:00.676
Under deep...

01:20:03.804 --> 01:20:08.225
His hands were so warm.

01:20:10.185 --> 01:20:15.274
So when they touch my body,

01:20:17.943 --> 01:20:19.361
my body gets hot.

01:21:24.676 --> 01:21:25.928
Why are you acting like this?

01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:32.851
I took her tranquilizer...

01:21:33.685 --> 01:21:34.686
Why?

01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:36.271
I am in trouble.

01:21:37.105 --> 01:21:38.315
Help me.

01:21:43.153 --> 01:21:44.530
You must be crazy!

01:21:45.614 --> 01:21:47.199
She said shell give birth
to her child.

01:21:48.867 --> 01:21:51.036
If she delivers the baby,
thatd be the end of his life.

01:21:51.161 --> 01:21:52.579
As well as mine and the babys life.

01:21:55.457 --> 01:21:56.458
I cant.

01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:59.711
You told me my husband and you
are like soulmates.

01:22:01.713 --> 01:22:03.215
Even so, how can I do that?

01:22:03.465 --> 01:22:05.425
You are saying now
this is against your conscious?

01:22:05.717 --> 01:22:08.512
Is she more important than your husband?
You barely know her.

01:22:10.556 --> 01:22:12.516
Please help my husband, can you?

01:22:12.599 --> 01:22:14.560
Not for the sake of me,
but for the sake of him...

01:22:35.122 --> 01:22:36.248
Did you check the bank account?

01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:37.583
It is wired now.

01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:39.168
Lets get started now.

01:22:43.005 --> 01:22:44.423
Would you please leave us alone?

01:23:24.838 --> 01:23:27.299
I thought she was too young.

01:23:27.925 --> 01:23:30.219
Didnt you do a pregnancy test
before coming?

01:23:31.303 --> 01:23:33.555
She acted like
she was pregnant...

01:23:33.639 --> 01:23:37.643
She still has
the virginal membrane.

01:23:38.602 --> 01:23:40.646
She didnt have an intercourse
with a man even once.

01:23:43.023 --> 01:23:47.110
But no refund for
this imaginary surgery.

01:24:26.608 --> 01:24:28.068
Its fine, my baby.

01:24:29.361 --> 01:24:30.362
Its alright.

01:24:31.321 --> 01:24:34.700
Your mom will show you
only good things.

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.870
Ill make you dream
only good things.

01:24:38.954 --> 01:24:40.247
And..

01:24:46.837 --> 01:24:51.884
Your mom will keep you safe.

01:25:23.081 --> 01:25:27.711
My mom used to listen to
classical music

01:25:27.711 --> 01:25:29.922
when I was in her belly.

01:25:51.485 --> 01:25:53.148
I had a dream.

01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:56.406
A cold and scary one.

01:25:59.201 --> 01:26:02.329
I wanted to run away,
but I couldnt move at all.

01:26:04.122 --> 01:26:05.249
Drink it.

01:26:05.582 --> 01:26:07.459
It will make your body warm.

01:26:16.802 --> 01:26:18.595
Then after my body gets warm...

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.682
Will I get to fall a sleep again?

01:26:22.724 --> 01:26:23.892
What are you talking about?

01:26:26.812 --> 01:26:28.772
What did you do
after you slept me?

01:26:30.357 --> 01:26:31.984
What did I do...what?

01:26:33.819 --> 01:26:35.445
This is not a dream, is it?

01:26:44.413 --> 01:26:45.747
Its gone.

01:26:48.375 --> 01:26:49.668
Its gone.

01:27:00.512 --> 01:27:01.889
My babys gone.

01:27:03.849 --> 01:27:05.434
It was only your imagination.

01:27:06.727 --> 01:27:08.812
How do you know?

01:27:12.316 --> 01:27:14.234
How do you know about it?

01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:16.528
Have you cut my stomach?

01:27:17.404 --> 01:27:19.948
You never slept with a man.

01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:26.997
My baby...

01:27:27.497 --> 01:27:29.541
My baby...

01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:32.753
Its not fair.

01:27:33.462 --> 01:27:34.546
Very unfair.

01:27:37.591 --> 01:27:39.885
It would be fair
only when your babys gone too.

01:27:40.511 --> 01:27:41.803
- I will kill you.
- Dont do this to me.

01:27:41.803 --> 01:27:43.805
- I will kill you.
- Stop it.

01:27:43.805 --> 01:27:45.224
- Let me go, I will kill you.
- No, dont.

01:27:45.224 --> 01:27:47.351
- I will kill you.
- Stop.

01:27:47.351 --> 01:27:49.144
Stop! Let me go!

01:27:49.144 --> 01:27:51.021
I will kill you!

01:27:55.067 --> 01:27:56.568
Dont do this to me.

01:27:56.568 --> 01:27:58.278
Your pregnancy was
an imaginary one.

01:27:58.278 --> 01:27:59.780
How do you know?

01:28:00.322 --> 01:28:04.326
Seo-yeon!

01:28:04.451 --> 01:28:05.953
Let me go!

01:28:06.245 --> 01:28:07.538
Seo-yeon!

01:28:08.247 --> 01:28:09.665
Dont do this to me!

01:28:09.665 --> 01:28:11.124
Stop! Let me go!

01:28:12.584 --> 01:28:13.961
Stop it, please.

01:28:14.086 --> 01:28:15.087
Let me go!

01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:17.297
Stop.

01:28:18.715 --> 01:28:21.093
You stop too.
What are you doing?

01:28:21.093 --> 01:28:23.178
Knock it off!

01:28:25.264 --> 01:28:27.432
Whats going on?

01:28:28.058 --> 01:28:30.185
You know what your wife
did to me?

01:28:30.269 --> 01:28:31.770
She took me to a hospital.

01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:33.939
Dont listen to her!
Shes gone crazy!

01:28:33.939 --> 01:28:34.773
Dont listen to her!

01:28:34.773 --> 01:28:35.941
No!

01:28:35.941 --> 01:28:38.151
- Stop!
- Youre crazy, really crazy!

01:28:38.151 --> 01:28:40.070
Knock it off.

01:28:41.905 --> 01:28:43.866
What did she say?

01:28:44.616 --> 01:28:46.493
What is she talking about?

01:28:46.493 --> 01:28:47.995
I said shes insane!

01:28:47.995 --> 01:28:49.621
I am not crazy.

01:28:50.247 --> 01:28:53.625
Whats going on?

01:28:55.127 --> 01:28:56.628
- Whats going on?
- Mr. Kim.

01:28:56.628 --> 01:28:58.046
Seo-yeon.

01:28:59.464 --> 01:29:00.799
Seo-yeon!

01:29:01.008 --> 01:29:02.384
KIM Seo-yeon!

01:29:03.135 --> 01:29:04.511
Are you okay?

01:29:07.681 --> 01:29:08.515
Seo-yeon!

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.933
Hold on a second.

01:29:10.726 --> 01:29:11.852
Your wife...

01:29:13.645 --> 01:29:15.689
killed our baby.

01:29:16.315 --> 01:29:18.400
Our babys dead now.

01:29:20.944 --> 01:29:23.238
I am not crazy.

01:29:27.159 --> 01:29:28.994
I am not at all!

01:29:30.662 --> 01:29:33.248
Our babys dead.

01:30:02.319 --> 01:30:03.362
Isnt she adorable?

01:30:04.112 --> 01:30:05.113
Shes sleeping.

01:30:15.207 --> 01:30:16.875
- Take a rest.
- Thank you.

01:30:39.565 --> 01:30:41.108
Shes really cute.

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:42.985
Yes she is.

01:30:43.694 --> 01:30:44.778
Is everything okay?

01:30:45.404 --> 01:30:48.282
Yes, shes healthy
though she came out earlier.

01:30:50.158 --> 01:30:51.410
I mean you.

01:30:59.126 --> 01:31:03.213
Can you forgive him...?

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.387
Hes my daughters dad, after all.

01:31:33.202 --> 01:31:34.286
Young-eun!

01:31:41.293 --> 01:31:42.711
What about Mr. Kims wife?

01:31:44.630 --> 01:31:47.007
Dont worry. Shes fine.

01:31:47.466 --> 01:31:48.967
The babys also healthy.

01:31:50.552 --> 01:31:53.555
Lets go. I will take you home.

01:31:59.978 --> 01:32:01.104
Young-eun,

01:32:02.814 --> 01:32:06.235
even if somebody holds you...

01:32:09.655 --> 01:32:10.781
who?

01:32:14.743 --> 01:32:17.329
Anybody, specially men.

01:32:18.956 --> 01:32:22.417
That doesnt always mean
they all love you.

01:32:25.170 --> 01:32:28.090
Even if they dont love you...

01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:42.062
It was a weird dream.

01:32:46.942 --> 01:32:48.902
I went to a hospital.

01:32:51.697 --> 01:32:53.031
So, then?

01:32:55.701 --> 01:32:56.827
Then...

01:32:59.454 --> 01:33:01.415
I saw you in my dream.

01:33:05.294 --> 01:33:06.879
Thats a strange dream.

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:37.868
Can you take that off my sight?

01:33:49.213 --> 01:33:51.340
I told you I would take you home.

01:34:23.497 --> 01:34:24.498
Why?

01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:28.168
That one.

01:34:40.389 --> 01:34:41.807
I almost forgot bringing it
with me.

01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:06.790
Do you just live with me...

01:35:08.959 --> 01:35:09.960
What.

01:35:11.879 --> 01:35:14.006
Do you just live with me
because you feel responsible?

01:35:15.591 --> 01:35:17.009
Why do you say so?

01:35:21.221 --> 01:35:24.600
My dream was to live like today.

01:35:27.811 --> 01:35:30.522
Waking up in the morning,
you are there.

01:35:31.648 --> 01:35:33.734
We eat breakfast together,

01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:37.571
then I wait for you to come back home
in the evening.

01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:41.783
We get to sleep together.

01:35:42.034 --> 01:35:44.286
I bring up children
who looks like you.

01:35:52.336 --> 01:35:53.837
Youve had everything
you dreamt about.

01:35:55.130 --> 01:35:56.131
Is that so?

01:36:00.886 --> 01:36:02.679
Then I am supposed to be happy.

01:36:12.397 --> 01:36:14.316
It will be freezing cold.

01:36:15.651 --> 01:36:17.110
It will be a scary place.

01:36:18.987 --> 01:36:21.949
But you have to bear in there
though it is dark.

01:36:24.493 --> 01:36:26.078
Youll be born again.

01:36:31.416 --> 01:36:32.918
My good baby.

01:36:34.586 --> 01:36:35.587
My baby.

01:37:07.119 --> 01:37:08.453
You might feel cold...

01:37:21.341 --> 01:37:22.926
Our baby...

01:37:23.886 --> 01:37:26.471
How could a baby be gone now?
It was lying on here a minute ago!

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.142
Come quickly.

01:37:30.976 --> 01:37:32.811
The baby is waiting.

01:37:40.068 --> 01:37:41.361
Please calm down little bit.

01:37:41.486 --> 01:37:43.864
How can I calm down
when the babys gone!

01:37:45.824 --> 01:37:46.950
Seo-yeon.

01:37:47.826 --> 01:37:49.661
Seo-yeon!

01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:01.381
Seo-yeon.

01:38:02.508 --> 01:38:03.509
Seo-yeon.

01:38:06.512 --> 01:38:07.179
Where are you going?

01:38:07.304 --> 01:38:08.305
Let me go!

01:38:09.515 --> 01:38:11.892
Young-eun wants me.
I was told me to come alone.

01:38:12.643 --> 01:38:13.644
Seo-yeon.

01:38:19.399 --> 01:38:20.484
Seo-yeon.

01:39:38.145 --> 01:39:39.354
Where is she?

01:39:41.356 --> 01:39:42.566
Youre late.

01:39:45.402 --> 01:39:46.403
Wheres my baby?

01:39:46.445 --> 01:39:49.531
Todays a tutoring day.

01:39:52.492 --> 01:39:53.827
Tutoring is done.

01:39:56.205 --> 01:39:58.290
But I still have things to learn.

01:40:01.168 --> 01:40:04.129
Then, I will teach you
whatever you want.

01:40:05.797 --> 01:40:08.133
Just bring my baby back, please?

01:40:09.176 --> 01:40:10.802
You want to hurt me only.

01:40:14.306 --> 01:40:15.766
Wheres my baby?

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.396
I dont need you.

01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:25.817
Can you leave now?

01:40:26.276 --> 01:40:31.114
You think you can be happy
only if I am disappeared?

01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:33.367
After all, you will also regret that

01:40:33.617 --> 01:40:35.536
you loved him with all you are.

01:40:37.621 --> 01:40:38.872
Like you?

01:40:40.916 --> 01:40:42.209
I am different.

01:40:46.255 --> 01:40:48.674
Yes, youre different.

01:40:49.341 --> 01:40:50.801
I agree with you.

01:40:51.301 --> 01:40:54.555
So, please...

01:40:55.514 --> 01:40:59.601

01:42:02.372 --> 01:42:05.375
You cant do this!

01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:07.002

01:42:33.028 --> 01:42:34.112

01:42:56.844 --> 01:42:58.053
Seo-yeon, I found the baby.

01:42:59.638 --> 01:43:01.765
The baby just looks like me.

01:43:03.517 --> 01:43:04.560
Where are you now?

01:43:05.936 --> 01:43:07.479
On the top of your head.

01:43:08.647 --> 01:43:09.773
On the rooftop

01:43:11.358 --> 01:43:12.359
Wheres Seo-yeon?

01:43:15.821 --> 01:43:17.865
Choose only one person.

01:43:18.991 --> 01:43:21.159
Is it me? Or your wife?

01:43:21.743 --> 01:43:22.744
What?

01:43:45.058 --> 01:43:46.977
I knew you would choose me over her.

01:43:50.397 --> 01:43:51.857
Wheres my wife?

01:43:52.858 --> 01:43:54.359

01:43:54.526 --> 01:43:58.030
I meant Seo-yeon.
Wheres she now?

01:43:58.405 --> 01:43:59.448

Wheres Seo-yeon?

01:44:12.753 --> 01:44:14.838
I can do better than she can.

01:44:15.672 --> 01:44:16.673
Get out of my way!

01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:18.342
But you love me.

01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:20.260
Please stop doing this
and move away.

01:44:20.636 --> 01:44:22.221
Get out of my way!

01:44:22.721 --> 01:44:24.258
You love me, dont you?

01:44:25.349 --> 01:44:26.433
Move, quickly.

01:44:46.495 --> 01:44:47.871

You found her?

01:45:07.432 --> 01:45:09.017
You really found the baby?

01:45:10.143 --> 01:45:11.520

01:45:11.770 --> 01:45:13.230
Are you alright?

01:45:14.273 --> 01:45:17.025
You found the baby...

01:46:03.989 --> 01:46:05.282

01:46:05.908 --> 01:46:07.492
Young-eun, come down.

01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:11.371
Young-eun, come down.

01:46:13.498 --> 01:46:15.334
Come down first and lets talk.

01:46:15.334 --> 01:46:16.710
Young-eun!

01:46:33.519 --> 01:46:34.895
Young-eun!

01:46:46.949 --> 01:46:48.617
Come down first and talk to me.

01:46:49.993 --> 01:46:51.787
Hold my hands.

01:46:53.038 --> 01:46:54.289
Young-eun.

01:47:12.057 --> 01:47:13.725
Young-eun, hold my hands.

01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:16.520
Hurry up.

01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:23.861
I was just your toy?

01:47:25.571 --> 01:47:27.656
Did you play with me?

01:47:30.742 --> 01:47:34.496
Did you like I acted cheap?

01:47:37.958 --> 01:47:39.751
Young-eun, it was not like that.

01:47:40.961 --> 01:47:42.254
Come here.

01:47:48.302 --> 01:47:50.596
But your heart was pounding.

01:47:52.514 --> 01:47:53.974
You remember, right?

01:47:58.353 --> 01:47:59.771
Young-eun.

01:48:00.272 --> 01:48:01.857
Young-eun.

01:48:02.608 --> 01:48:05.110
Hold my hands, please.

01:48:09.239 --> 01:48:11.700

Young-eun.

01:48:43.732 --> 01:48:45.400
Hold my hands tight.

01:48:54.284 --> 01:48:55.953
Honey, let go of her hands.

01:48:57.454 --> 01:48:59.122
Seo-yeon, help me.

01:49:00.916 --> 01:49:03.210
Shell be obsessed over you.

01:49:08.465 --> 01:49:10.259
She will never let you go.

01:49:10.384 --> 01:49:11.677
Seo-yeon!

01:49:13.846 --> 01:49:15.722
Let go of her hands.

01:49:16.723 --> 01:49:18.642

01:49:25.691 --> 01:49:27.359
Young-eun, please.

01:49:29.361 --> 01:49:34.032
What was it if it wasnt love?

01:49:41.081 --> 01:49:42.583
Young-eun...

01:49:46.044 --> 01:49:47.504
Then what...

01:49:50.215 --> 01:49:54.386
What are we for?

01:50:06.565 --> 01:50:07.858
Young-eun...

01:50:08.817 --> 01:50:10.777
Young-eun...

01:50:54.613 --> 01:50:56.907
We didnt do anything.

01:50:57.533 --> 01:50:59.326
She fell down alone.

01:51:01.954 --> 01:51:04.456
You were holding her hands
till the end.

01:51:06.083 --> 01:51:08.752
I had no choice...

01:51:08.836 --> 01:51:12.840
But you were holding her
really tight.

01:52:09.605 --> 01:52:11.398
Oh my dear.

01:52:12.399 --> 01:52:14.067
What can I do for you?

01:52:14.610 --> 01:52:16.069
I am sorry.

01:52:16.195 --> 01:52:18.030
Please dont cry.

01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:21.450

01:52:21.450 --> 01:52:23.160
Its alright.
