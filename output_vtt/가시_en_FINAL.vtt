00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:18.245
One! Two! Three! One


00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.163
Two


00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:25.377
Three, Four, Five!


00:01:25.878 --> 00:01:30.549
- Six! - He's so cute. - Seven, Eight. - He's so sexy.


00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:43.812
Nine! Ten! Before jumping in the pool, shake your wrists. Shake right wrists 4 times. One, two, three, four Enter now from the last row.


00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:48.317
Stop playing around. You'll get hurt. Next row.


00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.242
Attention here!


00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:03.790
Attention! One, two, three, four!


00:02:14.927 --> 00:02:16.595
What's she doing over there?


00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:40.285
One, Two, three, four! Reverse! Two, three, four! Roll your neck like this.


00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:44.289
Reverse!


00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.168
What's that?


00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.213
Why is she doing that?


00:02:55.634 --> 00:03:00.180
Come down! Come down immediately! Come down now!


00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.351
Stop playing around!


00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.817
Oh, my goodness What's going on with her?


00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.115
A crazy bitch


00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.545
U okay?


00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.203
Honey.


00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.625
Honey. Yes!


00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:57.631
What are you doing? I was looking for something. I can't find them.


00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:05.472
Where did it go? It's gone. Where did it go?


00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.599
You smoked.


00:05:08.392 --> 00:05:13.772
I didn't. You smell like cigarette. You liar.


00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:19.236
By the way, why didn't you use a moving and packing service? Do you know how expensive it is?


00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:29.913
Seo-yeon, where's my uniform and rugby ball?


00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:42.885
Why are you looking for them? The match starts from next week. You broke your arms again last year. I'm embarrassed if you wear a cast when we have a family gathering. I just want to watch the match.


00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.180
Where did they possibly go?


00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.684
Oh, here they are.


00:05:54.605 --> 00:06:05.324
Wow, they are washed and clean. Smell's so fresh. - Just watch the game only! - Without a doubt! I promise I'll just wear them and watch the match.


00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:22.674
Why a dodge ball all the time? I draw a line and pass a ball then they'd play by themselves for an hour. Let them play something else. Mothers will make a great fuss.


00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.385
They played kicked ball before.


00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.018
How's the new house? Does Seo-yeon like it? So so. Come to visit us some time when you are free.


00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.521
Pass me the ball.


00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:28.740
Are you okay?


00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:35.789
Your fingers might be broken if you try to catch those balls.


00:07:36.415 --> 00:07:40.502
I am not afraid of anything.


00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:44.298
When I was your age, I wasn't afraid of anything, either.


00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:51.513
What about now? What are you afraid of?


00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:54.808
Why should I tell you?


00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.191
So that I can scare you.


00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:08.614
Stop playing a joke on me, okay?


00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:14.703
Done! You may leave!


00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.628
Alright


00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:30.510
Hello.


00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:37.684
Hello.


00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:43.482
That's hilarious.


00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.945
Get into the classroom, quickly! Get into the classroom, quickly!


00:08:50.239 --> 00:09:08.882
Real-estate or stock... Not worth of investing these days. I see. Have you heard about shale gas? Dad, I heard that business is very promising. - Is that so? - Yes I've got some source. Do you want to join hand?


00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:16.306
I can't afford to do it. I don't have much money since I bought them an apartment. Did you finish unpacking?


00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.184
It was easy, we used a moving and packing service.


00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:31.530
How's the work at school? - Any difficulty? - Not really... He knows that you put him in there, so he'll take care of it. Please just enjoy your dinner. Alright


00:09:31.822 --> 00:09:33.407
I'll pay.


00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:45.961
Looks pretty. My husband bought it for me from a business trip. Buy some expensive bags like this too. Do you know how important for ladies to wear expensive ones as we get older?


00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:48.672
Look at you.


00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:54.761
One Marlboro Light, please.


00:09:57.306 --> 00:10:05.606
Are you here to buy something? Please buy me a strawberry milk. I should eat a lot to recover from the injury.


00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.609
I'll pay all together.


00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:17.868
By the way, why am I belongs to you? Three dollars, please.


00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:24.917
Want to drink?


00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:28.629
No, I'm fine. It looks like paint.


00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:32.549
- I like pink. - Such a kid.


00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:43.060
- I heard you used to be a rugby player? - Right I would like to learn too.


00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:47.564
Do you want me to hook you up? There's also a female team...


00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:32.109
Nice, nice. You catch it. There you go. Nice.


00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.333
Yes he won!


00:11:49.293 --> 00:12:12.524
You're having a dangerous taste these days. What? You know it. I saw her... She looked like a doll. Stop it, dude. Hook me up with her friends. Just finish the shower. You pervert. I'm not a pervert. Stop teasing me. So envy you. - Thank you. - You know there's a match next week? Take care of yourself.


00:12:38.634 --> 00:12:40.719
You may kiss me.


00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:45.307
Fasten your belt, I meant.


00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.127
What are you doing?


00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:19.925
Marking a boundary. Don't wash your car.


00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:28.559
Close the door. Get in.


00:13:29.268 --> 00:13:30.810
Get in!


00:13:40.237 --> 00:13:42.822
Don't make a space.


00:13:43.115 --> 00:13:46.910
Close the gap. Hurry up.


00:13:58.172 --> 00:13:59.673
Hurry up and let's go.


00:15:04.363 --> 00:15:22.005
They did quite well, but I just wonder how much they can move further. Let's see how much Yonsei Univ. can defend. Yonsei's strategy is to continue offense by keeping on its winning streak. But Korea Univ. has a strong defense strategy.


00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:40.732
Where is it?


00:15:47.573 --> 00:15:51.451
Why are you toiling yourself late night? I'll help you tomorrow.


00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:54.954
I'm fine.


00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:44.630
- What are you looking for? - Are you looking for this? - Yes. - I look pretty? - Sure. - Did you pick it at the school? - I did. - I'll wear it. - As you want.


00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:41.186
Honey.


00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:43.689
Honey, wait.


00:17:46.942 --> 00:17:48.610
Honey.


00:17:55.284 --> 00:17:58.036
It seems too deep.


00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:45.459
Hello?


00:18:45.876 --> 00:18:52.966
Oh, hi. I called you a couple of times for the water leaking from the ceiling...


00:19:13.237 --> 00:19:17.324
Mr. Kim! Why are you still here?


00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:21.954
I was going to run out, but it's raining too much.


00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:25.666
I will go back home when the rain stops.


00:19:30.921 --> 00:19:32.297
Are you cold?


00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:35.217
Yes, I am.


00:19:51.942 --> 00:19:54.111
Do you feel better now?


00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:56.905
Is it delicious?


00:19:57.447 --> 00:20:02.536
I am just drinking it because I am cold. You should drink something else then.


00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:06.540
But no strawberry milk in the vending machine.


00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.796
Aren't you tired of it?


00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:18.385
When I am into one thing, I only eat that one.


00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:22.097
Hurry up drinking. You'd better get going now.


00:20:23.974 --> 00:20:26.226
But it's still raining.


00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.194
It'll stop soon.


00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:41.992
But I'd like to be with you more.


00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:49.833
I'll scold you if you keep acting up.


00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:10.646
How do you think about me?


00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:26.995
If you are done drinking, just get up.


00:21:31.542 --> 00:21:33.377
I should've drank it slowly.


00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:42.970
You might catch a cold change to this clothes.


00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:50.310
Why? Does it smell sweat?


00:21:52.563 --> 00:21:54.773
It smells you.


00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:57.860
Hurry up and change.


00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.326
What are you hesitating?


00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.539
Should I enter alone? Then what?


00:22:12.457 --> 00:22:13.959
I'm scared...


00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:17.671
You said you aren't afraid of anything.


00:22:18.422 --> 00:22:22.301
Did I say I'm afraid? I told you I am scared.


00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.985
Don't close the door, please.


00:22:40.194 --> 00:22:41.778
I'm scared.


00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:06.011
Are you done?


00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.847
But the zipper doesn't work.


00:23:09.348 --> 00:23:11.141
Try again.


00:23:11.975 --> 00:23:13.936
It seems broken.


00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:18.774
Hook the bottom part well, then it will work.


00:23:20.984 --> 00:23:22.986
It still doesn't work.


00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:33.121
Try it again.


00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:36.416
I am telling you, it's not working.


00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.672
Try your best.


00:23:47.094 --> 00:23:49.096
Look!


00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:51.598
This zipper really does not work.


00:24:03.026 --> 00:24:05.279
Can you please do this for me?


00:24:44.193 --> 00:24:46.153
I'll head out now


00:24:47.487 --> 00:24:49.281
so you take your time.


00:25:05.339 --> 00:25:07.506
Please don't leave me alone.


00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:09.927
I'm scared...


00:26:28.005 --> 00:26:29.798
Wait for me.


00:26:33.093 --> 00:26:34.678
Wait a minute.


00:27:22.518 --> 00:27:27.731
Your heart is racing. Just be quiet.


00:27:36.907 --> 00:27:38.700
You're hurting me.


00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.708
It hurts.


00:27:47.417 --> 00:27:49.211
I told you it hurts.


00:27:49.545 --> 00:27:51.213
Be quite!


00:28:15.112 --> 00:28:16.905
Who's there?


00:28:20.742 --> 00:28:22.202
Is somebody there?


00:28:28.083 --> 00:28:29.751
Who's that?


00:28:32.171 --> 00:28:33.881
Who's that over there?


00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.484
Young-eun.


00:28:55.986 --> 00:28:57.571
Young-eun.


00:28:57.988 --> 00:28:59.698
Young-eun.


00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:04.119
Young-eun.


00:29:09.875 --> 00:29:11.543
Young-eun.


00:29:15.005 --> 00:29:16.590
Young-eun.


00:29:38.904 --> 00:29:43.492
Everybody's off home. He must have left...


00:29:44.034 --> 00:29:45.452
Wait a minute.


00:29:46.578 --> 00:29:48.080
Who's there?


00:29:50.707 --> 00:29:52.709
Oh, Mr. Kim.


00:29:53.001 --> 00:29:56.713
Haven't you left the school yet? Yes.


00:29:58.882 --> 00:30:03.095
He's here... Yes. Honey.


00:30:05.138 --> 00:30:06.431
Yeah...


00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.069
Why didn't you pick up the phone?


00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.989
I didn't know you called me. It was in the bag.


00:30:26.618 --> 00:30:28.495
It seems the rain stopped.


00:30:31.456 --> 00:30:32.749
Honey.


00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.336
Honey!


00:30:36.962 --> 00:30:38.755
It's stopped.


00:30:41.508 --> 00:30:45.095
I left something at school.


00:30:45.304 --> 00:30:48.182
Can you go ahead? I will grab it and go home.


00:30:49.766 --> 00:30:51.643
Let's go together, honey.


00:30:54.438 --> 00:30:56.023
Well...


00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.484
I'll just pick it up later. Let's go.


00:31:05.324 --> 00:31:15.959
Honey. I inquired at the real-estate, the internet and so on. They all say the upstairs people should pay for the water leak from the ceiling.


00:31:17.794 --> 00:31:19.171
Honey.


00:31:20.172 --> 00:31:21.757
Honey.


00:33:35.265 --> 00:33:37.351
- Hello, Mr. Kim


00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:44.650
- Mr. Kim.


00:33:46.193 --> 00:33:49.488
Ju-hee. Is HA Young-eun absent today?


00:33:50.822 --> 00:33:54.826
Hey, have you seen Young-eun? Nope.


00:34:44.084 --> 00:34:45.752
Mr. Kim.


00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:52.092
What are you doing over there?


00:34:57.931 --> 00:34:59.433
Here you go.


00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:02.477
I am relieved. I was looking for it.


00:35:05.189 --> 00:35:06.773
Are you okay?


00:35:10.194 --> 00:35:13.614
About what happened yesterday...


00:35:14.865 --> 00:35:16.617
I apologize you.


00:35:20.204 --> 00:35:21.955
I was scared.


00:35:23.081 --> 00:35:25.083
Why did you leave me alone?


00:35:27.211 --> 00:35:28.879
I actually came back soon.


00:35:31.048 --> 00:35:33.425
I should've waited for longer...


00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:37.429
About yesterday...


00:35:40.557 --> 00:35:42.851
Have you talked to anyone about it?


00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.191
How can I tell people about things like that?


00:35:51.652 --> 00:35:53.695
Young-eun, about yesterday...


00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:57.449
Can it be a secret between you and me?


00:36:01.912 --> 00:36:03.664
Two of us?


00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.291
Yeah, two of us


00:36:09.044 --> 00:36:10.629
Two of us...


00:36:15.342 --> 00:36:16.760
Mr. Kim!


00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:21.139
It is a secret just between you and me...


00:36:26.103 --> 00:36:27.479
The secret is sealed.


00:36:45.205 --> 00:36:50.669
The teacher's kiss was sour and sweet


00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.589
just like lemonade.


00:37:07.644 --> 00:37:12.441
When the thunder struck, I happened to jump into his bosom.


00:37:13.984 --> 00:37:18.280
Just like the time he held me when I fell into the pool, I was relieved.


00:37:45.224 --> 00:37:50.938
Soon his hands started groping around my boobs.


00:37:51.563 --> 00:37:57.361
Then soon they came into my body.


00:38:00.864 --> 00:38:08.580
His fingers in my body were warm and firm.


00:38:20.175 --> 00:38:21.635
Be quite.


00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:23.929
It says they were warm and firm.


00:38:25.013 --> 00:38:29.685
You, what's that? This is damn funny. Unbelievable.


00:38:32.938 --> 00:38:34.731
It is shocking.


00:38:35.566 --> 00:38:36.942
What are they doing?


00:38:37.234 --> 00:38:38.902
Aren't they watching a porno?


00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.076
What's up?


00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:47.661
What are you doing?


00:38:51.582 --> 00:38:53.125
Step aside


00:39:07.514 --> 00:39:09.516
Online diary...


00:39:10.475 --> 00:39:11.977
Did you write the diary?


00:39:13.353 --> 00:39:14.730
Yes.


00:39:15.856 --> 00:39:18.942
Is it all true? What do you mean?


00:39:19.443 --> 00:39:21.653
Mr. Kim, I mean...


00:39:22.779 --> 00:39:29.912
Did some teacher do that to you?


00:39:31.163 --> 00:39:33.332
What does it mean "doing that to me"?


00:39:36.835 --> 00:39:38.170
I mean...


00:39:41.173 --> 00:39:44.259
Your body...


00:39:45.886 --> 00:39:47.387
He touched it...


00:39:48.013 --> 00:39:51.475
Did he really do that to you?


00:40:05.948 --> 00:40:07.533
It's only a fiction.


00:40:11.537 --> 00:40:14.623
So you just made it up?


00:40:16.208 --> 00:40:17.668
Yes.


00:40:18.502 --> 00:40:21.171
I am not suspicious of you, Mr. Kim.


00:40:24.049 --> 00:40:25.926
But it's just the nature of this school.


00:40:28.136 --> 00:40:32.599
Kids grow only in this town from kindergarten to high school.


00:40:33.225 --> 00:40:41.066
So they are quite naive. Their standard of living is similar to each other. There are no cheeky students in this school.


00:40:41.275 --> 00:40:50.448
So their parents keep watching the school carefully. Even if you are clean, the school has to take an action against you.


00:40:51.702 --> 00:40:54.037
You should behave yourself in every situation from now on.


00:40:54.955 --> 00:40:58.625
No more rumors about you and student.


00:40:59.376 --> 00:41:00.961
Aren't you embarrassed?


00:41:01.253 --> 00:41:08.218
Don't you know any shame at your age? Why are you mad at me? What on earth did you write the story? Why did you write it?


00:41:09.928 --> 00:41:11.847
So that I wouldn't forget about it.


00:41:12.264 --> 00:41:15.726
It's not even a lie. I know it's not a lie. It's a real story.


00:41:19.646 --> 00:41:21.648
Now you are driving me crazy!


00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:28.030
You look like a stranger.


00:41:34.203 --> 00:41:36.872
Catch the ball. Go catch!


00:41:39.041 --> 00:41:42.920
You should've given the penalty to that team, but not to us! Are you blind?


00:41:45.422 --> 00:41:46.840
Here!


00:41:47.591 --> 00:41:49.051
Catch it.


00:42:00.979 --> 00:42:07.486
Jun-gi. Are you having an affair? What do you mean? Who's "Strawberry Milk"?


00:42:09.071 --> 00:42:11.907
She texted you 10 times.


00:42:13.325 --> 00:42:15.160
It says she's waiting for you at the rooftop.


00:42:26.004 --> 00:42:28.674
Finished already? Here's more.


00:42:31.552 --> 00:43:02.165
By the way, Hyung-seok quit the job? He did. Then there's a coach vacancy, isn't it? Why? Do you want the job? I wanna cut out this teaching job. Shit! Nuts to you! Dude, where can you find a job like a teacher? Banks give you a low interest. And when your children are growing, do you know how much they spend money? And you are going to have the second baby. The baby is the first one, you idiot. You blockhead!


00:43:02.666 --> 00:43:05.085
Why is it the first one?


00:43:05.586 --> 00:43:13.010
Didn't you get married because you knocked up your wife? You quit playing when you were on a roll, so the team made fuss about it.


00:43:13.343 --> 00:43:15.304
I have a behind story.


00:43:16.054 --> 00:43:17.514
None of your business.


00:43:22.186 --> 00:43:24.062
Pick up the phone, you bastard.


00:44:00.974 --> 00:44:03.268
I set the table for you, so eat.


00:44:19.535 --> 00:44:22.913
If the secretary calls, tell him to look out for a new one.


00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.541
I'll only work until the end of this month...


00:44:46.937 --> 00:44:48.730
This supermarket is too expensive.


00:44:52.192 --> 00:44:55.779
Honey, I started a tutoring job.


00:44:56.947 --> 00:44:59.157
How can you teach in that condition?


00:44:59.575 --> 00:45:01.159
Any job is helpful for us.


00:45:01.827 --> 00:45:04.329
It takes a lot of money to raise a child.


00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:11.712
Honey, are you done shopping?


00:45:14.298 --> 00:45:15.549
Let's go to a wholesale instead.


00:45:15.841 --> 00:45:17.426
Okay.


00:45:33.817 --> 00:45:35.277
Hello.


00:45:36.945 --> 00:45:38.736
Hello.


00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.742
Mr. Kim.


00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:47.164
Mr. Kim.


00:45:48.999 --> 00:45:50.748
I miss you...


00:46:29.581 --> 00:46:31.959
- Hello. - Hello.


00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.796
I envy you, Mr. Kim.


00:46:39.132 --> 00:46:41.134
You are so popular.


00:47:07.411 --> 00:47:10.414
Honey, I am back. Are you?


00:47:10.747 --> 00:47:17.212
You must be hungry. Yeah, my throat is dry. I will cook something tasty.


00:47:20.591 --> 00:47:28.974
- Wait a second. - Why? I want to show you something. But I am starving. Just one second. What is it?


00:47:29.641 --> 00:47:31.310
Ta-da!


00:47:32.936 --> 00:47:34.396
Hey presto!


00:47:35.439 --> 00:47:36.815
So cute, huh?


00:47:37.357 --> 00:47:39.151
Seo-yeon, what are all these?


00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:43.155
It was possible because of the girl.


00:47:51.914 --> 00:47:53.373
Welcome.


00:47:57.836 --> 00:48:01.340
I didn't know she was your student. This isn't a coincidence that we met.


00:48:09.348 --> 00:48:12.100
I think he's feeling uncomfortable around me.


00:48:14.561 --> 00:48:16.438
No, he isn't.


00:48:29.993 --> 00:48:35.040
The soup is tasty. Do you want some more? Yes, Mam.


00:48:57.563 --> 00:48:59.773
- Thank you. - Help yourself.


00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.778
I will sleep over here.


00:49:07.322 --> 00:49:09.116
Tell her to sleep over.


00:49:09.366 --> 00:49:12.035
She said her parents are out for ancestral rite.


00:49:13.453 --> 00:49:15.247
She will scared left alone at home.


00:49:17.249 --> 00:49:18.584
Please?


00:49:46.445 --> 00:49:48.989
When we listen to Bach, you'll have good memory.


00:49:52.743 --> 00:49:55.329
Seo-yeon... Why?


00:49:55.996 --> 00:50:00.292
Young-eun... Yeah, she's so pretty.


00:50:01.126 --> 00:50:03.879
I wish I could give a birth to a daughter like her.


00:50:05.923 --> 00:50:07.424
You'd better stop the tutoring.


00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.011
How come?


00:50:11.762 --> 00:50:14.848
Just quit it. I don't feel comfortable.


00:50:16.391 --> 00:50:19.269
But I already received the tuition fee.


00:50:22.314 --> 00:50:24.816
Why don't you just return it?


00:50:26.235 --> 00:50:29.404
I already bought some medicine for your mother.


00:50:34.284 --> 00:50:35.953
Young-eun...


00:50:38.163 --> 00:50:40.040
She likes me.


00:50:49.007 --> 00:50:50.926
Kids at that age have a thing on a teacher.


00:51:40.726 --> 00:51:42.227
Are you crazy?


00:51:44.563 --> 00:51:46.732
Don't do it. She'll soon wake up.


00:51:51.278 --> 00:51:54.489
What are you up to? Stop playing.


00:51:55.407 --> 00:51:58.493
I said stop it. Is it because I am poor at this?


00:51:58.827 --> 00:52:00.245
I will try my best.


00:52:03.415 --> 00:52:05.167
Young-eun, Young-eun!


00:52:08.295 --> 00:52:12.799
Guys like these things. Stop it.


00:52:14.927 --> 00:52:16.512
Young-eun!


00:52:20.265 --> 00:52:21.642
Don't do it!


00:52:25.479 --> 00:52:28.649
Honey!


00:52:50.546 --> 00:52:57.719
The baby due is coming soon. Yes, 2 weeks left. Does your school know about Young-eun?


00:52:58.846 --> 00:53:00.097
Huh?


00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:06.979
About the tutoring... I am worried if he would be in a trouble. It's a bit strange that he wants me to stop teaching.


00:53:07.938 --> 00:53:11.024
It wouldn't do any good to him.


00:53:11.567 --> 00:53:17.281
The principal is also walking on eggshells around Young-eun? I heard she is a secret child of a CEO of a large company.


00:53:17.656 --> 00:53:24.371
How do you know about it? The thing moves very fast. People here gossip a lot.


00:53:26.665 --> 00:53:37.801
Now you know how to compress the chest. Yes. I'll show you a demonstration. Who wants to volunteer? Me!


00:53:42.181 --> 00:53:43.932
Ju-hee, come out.


00:53:44.349 --> 00:53:45.976
What?


00:53:46.518 --> 00:53:49.271
What is he doing? Be quiet, everyone!


00:53:49.688 --> 00:53:51.064
Lower your leg a bit and


00:53:51.899 --> 00:54:01.200
hold the forehead as I told you, then hold the chin. Where did I tell you to look at? Look at the chest. Yes. Look at your bosom at where you are.


00:54:06.205 --> 00:54:11.710
Quite down! Be quite! Ju-hee, go back to your place. Stop playing during class.


00:54:13.545 --> 00:54:17.341
- Did I make myself clear? - Yes. Then let's practice now.


00:54:20.385 --> 00:54:37.444
Was it really good? You loved it? Get back to your senses. How do you feel that you kissed the PE teacher? It was my first kiss. Bullshit! How many times have you done the first kiss? So how did you like it? I don't know. I don't remember anything.


00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.660
Who's that?


00:54:45.452 --> 00:54:47.829
Who are you? Don't play with me.


00:54:52.042 --> 00:54:53.502
Who is that?


00:55:01.051 --> 00:55:12.938
How could this possibly happen? How in the world did you do the student management a student brought a knife and committed a terrible accident? What are you going to do with my daughter? Look at her face! What are you going to do, Mr. Kim?


00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.447
Please understand her she's just upset. But they said it wouldn't leave a scar.


00:55:23.282 --> 00:55:26.493
It happened in the female shower. There's nothing you could do at that time.


00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:29.371
School wants to drop the other shoe quietly.


00:55:29.913 --> 00:55:31.957
I should've not called out Ju-hee.


00:55:33.125 --> 00:55:35.127
So you think Young-eun did it?


00:55:40.757 --> 00:55:42.009
It's not Young-eun.


00:55:42.467 --> 00:55:44.178
There is a girl who took a shower with her.


00:55:46.138 --> 00:55:47.389
Did you know about it?


00:55:47.973 --> 00:55:49.516
Since from when on earth?


00:55:50.142 --> 00:55:53.395
All the stories on the online board... Are they all real?


00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:12.623
Come to your senses. - Where are we? - We are at home. - Home? - Let's go. Min-ju, I'm sorry...


00:56:26.011 --> 00:56:28.680
- Pick up the phone... - Hey, what are you touching?


00:56:30.682 --> 00:56:34.520
Please come around. I feel... like to die. I'm not kidding.


00:56:41.068 --> 00:56:48.033
We had an accident at school. Did you two drink? No, with teachers at school.


00:56:48.367 --> 00:56:49.868
We're almost there.


00:56:55.916 --> 00:57:00.254
Why didn't you stop him? Did you just leave him get dead drunk?


00:57:04.716 --> 00:57:06.093
Lie down.


00:57:08.053 --> 00:57:09.429
What are you doing there?


00:57:10.639 --> 00:57:12.015
It's already late.


00:57:13.141 --> 00:57:16.645
You're right. I'm off now.


00:57:30.117 --> 00:57:31.618
Thank you,


00:57:32.744 --> 00:57:34.121
for lying-


00:57:35.956 --> 00:57:38.458
There are many people who saw two of you together.


00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:44.173
- Just in case that you misinterpret it. - I don't misinterpret.


00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:47.968
You and my husband are old friends. That's howl understand.


00:57:51.096 --> 00:57:52.723
I agree. I'm sorry.


00:57:53.056 --> 00:57:54.600
It's late I'd better be off.


00:57:57.769 --> 00:57:59.313
People gossip a lot in this town.


00:58:00.397 --> 00:58:01.690
Please be careful.


00:58:05.027 --> 00:58:06.195
I'm begging you.


00:58:24.296 --> 00:58:33.013
When P, H, and P are well combined, you'll see more than 2 of linear relations.


00:58:37.559 --> 00:58:38.810
Do you like it?


00:58:39.144 --> 00:58:40.729
I want to try it on.


00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:44.274
But people don't take off a wedding ring for good.


00:58:45.192 --> 00:58:47.194
I saw you taking it off when you did the laundry.


00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.989
Alright! Just once.


00:58:53.659 --> 00:58:55.619
My fingers seem swollen that it wouldn't take off.


00:59:02.125 --> 00:59:03.877
Take time...Slowly...


00:59:14.555 --> 00:59:16.557
I guess you like somebody?


00:59:17.724 --> 00:59:19.226
I actually love somebody.


00:59:20.269 --> 00:59:21.854
It's not "like"?


00:59:22.771 --> 00:59:24.523
How much do you love him?


00:59:27.609 --> 00:59:32.072
As much as I can cut my one leg to give it to him.


00:59:39.997 --> 00:59:41.748
Who would like to receive that?


00:59:48.881 --> 00:59:51.884
How much do you love Mr. Kim?


00:59:58.724 --> 00:59:59.975
Let me see...


01:00:00.642 --> 01:00:06.648
Can you cut your one finger for him?


01:00:14.656 --> 01:00:16.408
Time's up.


01:00:16.658 --> 01:00:18.243
Let's call it a day.


01:00:26.752 --> 01:00:28.212
You may leave.


01:00:29.046 --> 01:00:30.589
I'll leave when Mr. Kim's back home.


01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:35.427
Why? Do you have something to talk to him? I will tell him.


01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:39.636
It's a secret...


01:00:40.599 --> 01:00:41.892
between him and me.


01:00:44.811 --> 01:00:46.188
Is that so?


01:00:46.605 --> 01:00:48.106
He's here!


01:00:51.777 --> 01:00:53.320
You're home.


01:00:54.571 --> 01:00:57.824
Why are you so late? I have waited for you so long.


01:00:58.992 --> 01:01:00.410
Hand it to me.


01:01:01.036 --> 01:01:02.621
Honey, I'm home.


01:01:03.038 --> 01:01:05.624
You're back. I'll change my clothes.


01:02:09.855 --> 01:02:13.400
Dinner's ready, honey. You're going to be late.


01:02:45.224 --> 01:02:47.100
The lid wouldn't open.


01:04:00.257 --> 01:04:01.633
Let's stop this.


01:04:03.594 --> 01:04:04.970
Why?


01:04:06.597 --> 01:04:08.640
You are afraid of me to tell her about us?


01:04:12.311 --> 01:04:15.189
I am not going to, so don't worry.


01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:20.319
Then your wife wouldn't let me in your house.


01:04:22.362 --> 01:04:23.739
Young-eun,


01:04:27.159 --> 01:04:29.661
I can't cheat on my wife anymore.


01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:36.877
Then, should I tell her everything?


01:05:15.624 --> 01:05:17.209
Honey, are you sleeping?


01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.419
No.


01:05:21.755 --> 01:05:23.924
I'm thinking I might quit school.


01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:39.231
Honey.


01:05:40.899 --> 01:05:41.942
Honey!


01:05:59.251 --> 01:06:01.128
It pays less than school but...


01:06:04.006 --> 01:06:05.465
I found a coaching position.


01:06:07.009 --> 01:06:08.093
Coach?


01:06:09.761 --> 01:06:10.762
Yes.


01:06:13.932 --> 01:06:15.434
Coaching job sounds only nice.


01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:19.646
But isn't it just a part-time job and you can be fired at any time?


01:06:21.273 --> 01:06:23.150
I'm confident I can do it well.


01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:26.153
Coaching job suits me.


01:06:29.031 --> 01:06:31.074
We are going to be parents soon.


01:06:31.783 --> 01:06:34.620
We cannot afford to live for the talent of your own.


01:06:35.245 --> 01:06:36.246
Seo-yeon,


01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:41.752
this is not about the matter of my talent.


01:06:45.047 --> 01:06:46.632
Then just bear with the teaching job.


01:06:47.508 --> 01:06:49.134
For the sake of our baby.


01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.225
I have something to tell you.


01:07:04.149 --> 01:07:05.984
You won't be able to handle this.


01:07:06.318 --> 01:07:07.528
It's too late.


01:07:07.861 --> 01:07:10.113
I don't want to listen to something I can't handle.


01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:42.354
Are you really going to quit tutoring?


01:07:43.397 --> 01:07:45.190
It's tough that my due date is coming soon.


01:07:52.072 --> 01:07:54.074
I can take care of a baby well.


01:07:54.449 --> 01:07:56.118
But it's tough for me.


01:08:00.414 --> 01:08:01.957
What's the smell?


01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:04.418
Beef leg bone broth.


01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:07.921
Do you want some?


01:08:25.522 --> 01:08:26.607
Are you okay?


01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:33.363
I am pregnant.


01:08:35.449 --> 01:08:36.450
What?


01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:23.695
I feel like I am riding on a ride.


01:13:24.738 --> 01:13:26.156
Let's do it one more time.


01:13:27.157 --> 01:13:28.404
Aren't you scared?


01:13:29.409 --> 01:13:30.536
Why am I scared?


01:13:33.205 --> 01:13:34.873
What if I push you?


01:13:35.832 --> 01:13:37.876
Why would you push me?


01:13:49.805 --> 01:13:51.223
Please forgive me.


01:13:52.724 --> 01:13:53.976
Forgive you for what?


01:13:55.644 --> 01:13:57.604
I have a wife.


01:14:01.525 --> 01:14:02.818
I know.


01:14:03.235 --> 01:14:04.736
I will forgive you.


01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:07.781
I'll have a child soon.


01:14:08.615 --> 01:14:10.200
I know that too.


01:14:11.076 --> 01:14:12.870
I will forgive you.


01:14:15.747 --> 01:14:17.040
I love you.


01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:29.052
I adore you.


01:14:40.355 --> 01:14:41.940
What's the matter?


01:14:44.818 --> 01:14:47.404
So is everything going to be okay only if your wife is not around?


01:15:34.201 --> 01:15:35.536
Mr. Kim.


01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:40.374
Mr. Kim.


01:16:00.853 --> 01:16:01.854
Isn't it pretty?


01:16:02.521 --> 01:16:04.560
I remember those time.


01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.526
He shivered his hands so much


01:16:08.861 --> 01:16:10.863
it took him a while to put the ring on me.


01:16:12.114 --> 01:16:13.991
Perhaps, he didn't want to put it on you.


01:16:17.536 --> 01:16:18.662
Is that so?


01:16:21.206 --> 01:16:25.002
Anyways, I am wearing this ring on my finger.


01:16:26.378 --> 01:16:30.340
That looks like handcuffs,


01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:34.428
that you won't be able to move at all.


01:16:40.559 --> 01:16:42.561
Maybe he wants the baby for that reason?


01:16:52.029 --> 01:16:56.241
These days, Mr. Kim looks different from these pictures.


01:16:58.368 --> 01:17:00.162
It seems he needs love.


01:17:00.954 --> 01:17:03.165
You know, married couples live by more than love itself.


01:17:06.084 --> 01:17:10.881
Marriage is a whole lot different from romantic feelings.


01:17:12.382 --> 01:17:15.219
I don't need more than love.


01:17:15.886 --> 01:17:18.805
He didn't promise you for anything and he is not responsible for you.


01:17:19.932 --> 01:17:22.100
Without a ring, not spending any money?


01:17:27.773 --> 01:17:31.068
He would thank to you! For you were easy to play with.


01:17:37.074 --> 01:17:38.909
You were only a toy to him.


01:17:39.576 --> 01:17:41.912
It's love. Do you date at all?


01:17:42.412 --> 01:17:44.414
Does he kiss on you when he sends you off?


01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:46.662
How many times does he call you a day?


01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:48.627
Doesn't he happen to pick up your phone?


01:17:49.169 --> 01:17:56.718
He's probably fed up with you. - No, he's not. - Why do you deny? It's time to leave him for he's fed up with you. He's only fed up with these pictures.


01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:59.680
Just go away from him!


01:18:18.407 --> 01:18:19.825
How was it. When you slept with him?


01:18:21.702 --> 01:18:22.828
Did you enjoy?


01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:32.629
Of course.


01:18:40.721 --> 01:18:42.306
How did he touch you?


01:18:48.228 --> 01:18:49.479
Did you feel him?


01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:08.123
Are you really curious?


01:19:13.045 --> 01:19:14.630
How should I start the story...


01:19:21.053 --> 01:19:25.224
I was startled at first.


01:19:27.267 --> 01:19:28.764
It hurt much


01:19:31.647 --> 01:19:36.151
because he grabbed my bosom tight


01:19:37.861 --> 01:19:38.987
like this.


01:19:45.202 --> 01:19:46.370
And then?


01:19:48.705 --> 01:19:54.086
Then slowly


01:19:55.003 --> 01:19:56.380
he moved his hands down.


01:19:59.299 --> 01:20:00.676
Under deep...


01:20:03.804 --> 01:20:08.225
His hands were so warm.


01:20:10.185 --> 01:20:15.274
So when they touch my body,


01:20:17.943 --> 01:20:19.361
my body gets hot.


01:21:24.676 --> 01:21:25.928
Why are you acting like this?


01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:32.851
I took her tranquilizer...


01:21:33.685 --> 01:21:34.686
Why?


01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:36.271
I am in trouble.


01:21:37.105 --> 01:21:38.315
Help me.


01:21:43.153 --> 01:21:44.530
You must be crazy!


01:21:45.614 --> 01:21:47.199
She said she'll give birth to her child.


01:21:48.867 --> 01:21:51.036
If she delivers the baby, that'd be the end of his life.


01:21:51.161 --> 01:21:52.579
As well as mine and the baby's life.


01:21:55.457 --> 01:21:56.458
I can't.


01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:59.711
You told me my husband and you are like soulmates.


01:22:01.713 --> 01:22:03.215
Even so, how can I do that?


01:22:03.465 --> 01:22:05.425
You are saying now this is against your conscience?


01:22:05.717 --> 01:22:08.512
Is she more important than your husband? You barely know her.


01:22:10.556 --> 01:22:14.560
Please help my husband, can you? Not for the sake of me, but for the sake of him...


01:22:35.122 --> 01:22:37.583
Did you check the bank account? It is wired now.


01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:39.168
Let's get started now.


01:22:43.005 --> 01:22:44.423
Would you please leave us alone?


01:23:24.838 --> 01:23:27.299
I thought she was too young.


01:23:27.925 --> 01:23:30.219
Didn't you do a pregnancy test before coming?


01:23:31.303 --> 01:23:37.643
She acted like she was pregnant... She still has the virginal membrane.


01:23:38.602 --> 01:23:40.646
She didn't have an intercourse with a man even once.


01:23:43.023 --> 01:23:47.110
But no refund for this imaginary surgery.


01:24:26.608 --> 01:24:28.068
It's fine, my baby.


01:24:29.361 --> 01:24:30.362
It's alright.


01:24:31.321 --> 01:24:34.700
Your mom will show you only good things.


01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.870
I'll make you dream only good things.


01:24:38.954 --> 01:24:40.247
And..


01:24:46.837 --> 01:24:51.884
Your mom will keep you safe.


01:25:23.081 --> 01:25:29.922
My mom used to listen to classical music when I was in her belly.


01:25:51.485 --> 01:25:53.148
I had a dream.


01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:56.406
A cold and scary one.


01:25:59.201 --> 01:26:02.329
I wanted to run away, but I couldn't move at all.


01:26:04.122 --> 01:26:05.249
Drink it.


01:26:05.582 --> 01:26:07.459
It will make your body warm.


01:26:16.802 --> 01:26:18.595
Then after my body gets warm...


01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.682
Will I get to fall a sleep again?


01:26:22.724 --> 01:26:23.892
What are you talking about?


01:26:26.812 --> 01:26:28.772
What did you do after you slept me?


01:26:30.357 --> 01:26:31.984
What did I do...what?


01:26:33.819 --> 01:26:35.445
This is not a dream, is it?


01:26:44.413 --> 01:26:45.747
It's gone.


01:26:48.375 --> 01:26:49.668
It's gone.


01:27:00.512 --> 01:27:01.889
My baby's gone.


01:27:03.849 --> 01:27:05.434
It was only your imagination.


01:27:06.727 --> 01:27:08.812
How do you know?


01:27:12.316 --> 01:27:14.234
How do you know about it?


01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:16.528
Have you cut my stomach?


01:27:17.404 --> 01:27:19.948
You never slept with a man.


01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:26.997
My baby...


01:27:27.497 --> 01:27:29.541
My baby...


01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:32.753
It's not fair.


01:27:33.462 --> 01:27:34.546
Very unfair.


01:27:37.591 --> 01:27:39.885
It would be fair only when your baby's gone too.


01:27:40.511 --> 01:27:51.021
- I will kill you. - Don't do this to me. - I will kill you. - Stop it. - Let me go, I will kill you. - No, don't. - I will kill you. - Stop. Stop! Let me go! I will kill you!


01:27:55.067 --> 01:27:59.780
Don't do this to me. Your pregnancy was an imaginary one. How do you know?


01:28:00.322 --> 01:28:05.953
Seo-yeon! Let me go!


01:28:06.245 --> 01:28:07.538
Seo-yeon!


01:28:08.247 --> 01:28:11.124
Don't do this to me! Stop! Let me go!


01:28:12.584 --> 01:28:15.087
Stop it, please. Let me go!


01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:17.297
Stop.


01:28:18.715 --> 01:28:23.178
You stop too. What are you doing? Knock it off!


01:28:25.264 --> 01:28:27.432
What's going on?


01:28:28.058 --> 01:28:40.070
You know what your wife did to me? She took me to a hospital. Don't listen to her! She's gone crazy! Don't listen to her! No! - Stop! - You're crazy, really crazy! Knock it off.


01:28:41.905 --> 01:28:43.866
What did she say?


01:28:44.616 --> 01:28:49.621
What is she talking about? I said she's insane! I am not crazy.


01:28:50.247 --> 01:28:53.625
What's going on?


01:28:55.127 --> 01:28:58.046
- What's going on? - Mr. Kim. Seo-yeon.


01:28:59.464 --> 01:29:00.799
Seo-yeon!


01:29:01.008 --> 01:29:02.384
KIM Seo-yeon!


01:29:03.135 --> 01:29:04.511
Are you okay?


01:29:07.681 --> 01:29:09.933
Seo-yeon! Hold on a second.


01:29:10.726 --> 01:29:11.852
Your wife...


01:29:13.645 --> 01:29:15.689
killed our baby.


01:29:16.315 --> 01:29:18.400
Our baby's dead now.


01:29:20.944 --> 01:29:23.238
I am not crazy.


01:29:27.159 --> 01:29:28.994
I am not at all!


01:29:30.662 --> 01:29:33.248
Our baby's dead.


01:30:02.319 --> 01:30:03.362
Isn't she adorable?


01:30:04.112 --> 01:30:05.113
She's sleeping.


01:30:15.207 --> 01:30:16.875
- Take a rest. - Thank you.


01:30:39.565 --> 01:30:41.108
She's really cute.


01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:42.985
Yes she is.


01:30:43.694 --> 01:30:44.778
Is everything okay?


01:30:45.404 --> 01:30:48.282
Yes, she's healthy though she came out earlier.


01:30:50.158 --> 01:30:51.410
I mean you.


01:30:59.126 --> 01:31:03.213
Can you forgive him...?


01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.387
He's my daughter's dad, after all.


01:31:33.202 --> 01:31:34.286
Young-eun!


01:31:41.293 --> 01:31:42.711
What about Mr. Kim's wife?


01:31:44.630 --> 01:31:47.007
Don't worry. She's fine.


01:31:47.466 --> 01:31:48.967
The baby's also healthy.


01:31:50.552 --> 01:31:53.555
Let's go. I will take you home.


01:31:59.978 --> 01:32:01.104
Young-eun,


01:32:02.814 --> 01:32:06.235
even if somebody holds you...


01:32:09.655 --> 01:32:10.781
who?


01:32:14.743 --> 01:32:17.329
Anybody, specially men.


01:32:18.956 --> 01:32:22.417
That doesn't always mean they all love you.


01:32:25.170 --> 01:32:28.090
Even if they don't love you...


01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:42.062
It was a weird dream.


01:32:46.942 --> 01:32:48.902
I went to a hospital.


01:32:51.697 --> 01:32:53.031
So, then?


01:32:55.701 --> 01:32:56.827
Then...


01:32:59.454 --> 01:33:01.415
I saw you in my dream.


01:33:05.294 --> 01:33:06.879
That's a strange dream.


01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:37.868
Can you take that off my sight?


01:33:49.213 --> 01:33:51.340
I told you I would take you home.


01:34:23.497 --> 01:34:24.498
Why?


01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:28.168
That one.


01:34:40.389 --> 01:34:41.807
I almost forgot bringing it with me.


01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:06.790
Do you just live with me...


01:35:08.959 --> 01:35:09.960
What.


01:35:11.879 --> 01:35:14.006
Do you just live with me because you feel responsible?


01:35:15.591 --> 01:35:17.009
Why do you say so?


01:35:21.221 --> 01:35:24.600
My dream was to live like today.


01:35:27.811 --> 01:35:30.522
Waking up in the morning, you are there.


01:35:31.648 --> 01:35:33.734
We eat breakfast together,


01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:37.571
then I wait for you to come back home in the evening.


01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:41.783
We get to sleep together.


01:35:42.034 --> 01:35:44.286
I bring up children who looks like you.


01:35:52.336 --> 01:35:53.837
You've had everything you dreamt about.


01:35:55.130 --> 01:35:56.131
Is that so?


01:36:00.886 --> 01:36:02.679
Then I am supposed to be happy.


01:36:12.397 --> 01:36:14.316
It will be freezing cold.


01:36:15.651 --> 01:36:17.110
It will be a scary place.


01:36:18.987 --> 01:36:21.949
But you have to bear in there though it is dark.


01:36:24.493 --> 01:36:26.078
You'll be born again.


01:36:31.416 --> 01:36:32.918
My good baby.


01:36:34.586 --> 01:36:35.587
My baby.


01:37:07.119 --> 01:37:08.453
You might feel cold...


01:37:21.341 --> 01:37:22.926
Our baby...


01:37:23.886 --> 01:37:26.471
How could a baby be gone now? It was lying on here a minute ago!


01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.142
Come quickly.


01:37:30.976 --> 01:37:32.811
The baby is waiting.


01:37:40.068 --> 01:37:43.864
Please calm down little bit. How can I calm down when the baby's gone!


01:37:45.824 --> 01:37:46.950
Seo-yeon.


01:37:47.826 --> 01:37:49.661
Seo-yeon!


01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:01.381
Seo-yeon.


01:38:02.508 --> 01:38:03.509
Seo-yeon.


01:38:06.512 --> 01:38:08.305
Where are you going? Let me go!


01:38:09.515 --> 01:38:11.892
Young-eun wants me. I was told me to come alone.


01:38:12.643 --> 01:38:13.644
Seo-yeon.


01:38:19.399 --> 01:38:20.484
Seo-yeon.


01:39:41.356 --> 01:39:42.566
You're late.


01:39:45.402 --> 01:39:49.531
Where's my baby? Today's a tutoring day.


01:39:52.492 --> 01:39:53.827
Tutoring is done.


01:39:56.205 --> 01:39:58.290
But I still have things to learn.


01:40:01.168 --> 01:40:04.129
Then, I will teach you whatever you want.


01:40:05.797 --> 01:40:08.133
Just bring my baby back, please?


01:40:09.176 --> 01:40:10.802
You want to hurt me only.


01:40:14.306 --> 01:40:15.766
Where's my baby?


01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.396
I don't need you.


01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:25.817
Can you leave now?


01:40:26.276 --> 01:40:31.114
You think you can be happy only if I am disappeared?


01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:33.367
After all, you will also regret that


01:40:33.617 --> 01:40:35.536
you loved him with all you are.


01:40:37.621 --> 01:40:38.872
Like you?


01:40:40.916 --> 01:40:42.209
I am different.


01:40:46.255 --> 01:40:48.674
Yes, you're different.


01:40:49.341 --> 01:40:50.801
I agree with you.


01:40:51.301 --> 01:40:54.555
So, please...


01:40:55.514 --> 01:40:59.601
Young-eun, return my baby, please.


01:41:01.895 --> 01:41:03.480
Where's my baby?


01:41:03.689 --> 01:41:04.773
Where's my baby?


01:41:07.568 --> 01:41:09.486
What if it's not too late yet?


01:41:24.543 --> 01:41:25.919
No!


01:41:26.378 --> 01:41:28.046
No! No!


01:41:54.698 --> 01:41:56.283
Where's my baby?


01:41:56.533 --> 01:41:57.910
My baby!


01:41:59.536 --> 01:42:00.954
Oh no!


01:42:02.372 --> 01:42:05.375
You can't do this!


01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:09.671
Where's the baby? Open the door!


01:42:10.422 --> 01:42:11.965
Where is the baby?


01:42:24.269 --> 01:42:25.938
Open the door!


01:42:27.981 --> 01:42:31.777
Open the door!


01:42:33.028 --> 01:42:34.112
Open the door!


01:42:56.844 --> 01:42:58.053
Seo-yeon, I found the baby.


01:42:59.638 --> 01:43:01.765
The baby just looks like me.


01:43:03.517 --> 01:43:04.560
Where are you now?


01:43:05.936 --> 01:43:07.479
On the top of your head.


01:43:08.647 --> 01:43:09.773
On the rooftop


01:43:11.358 --> 01:43:12.359
Where's Seo-yeon?


01:43:15.821 --> 01:43:17.865
Choose only one person.


01:43:18.991 --> 01:43:21.159
Is it me? Or your wife?


01:43:21.743 --> 01:43:22.744
What?


01:43:45.058 --> 01:43:46.977
I knew you would choose me over her.


01:43:50.397 --> 01:43:51.857
Where's my wife?


01:43:52.858 --> 01:43:58.030
I am here. I meant Seo-yeon. Where's she now?


01:43:58.405 --> 01:43:59.448
Please?


01:44:00.866 --> 01:44:02.784
Where's Seo-yeon?


01:44:12.753 --> 01:44:14.838
I can do better than she can.


01:44:15.672 --> 01:44:16.673
Get out of my way!


01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:18.342
But you love me.


01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:20.260
Please stop doing this and move away.


01:44:20.636 --> 01:44:22.221
Get out of my way!


01:44:22.721 --> 01:44:24.258
You love me, don't you?


01:44:25.349 --> 01:44:26.433
Move, quickly.


01:44:30.395 --> 01:44:31.772
Seo-yeon!


01:44:32.189 --> 01:44:33.524
Seo-yeon!


01:44:42.282 --> 01:44:43.659
Seo-yeon!


01:44:44.493 --> 01:44:49.289
- Seo-yeon - Honey. Seo-yeon! - Seo-yeon - Honey.


01:44:50.582 --> 01:44:52.709
I am here!


01:44:53.252 --> 01:44:55.128
- Seo-yeon - Honey.


01:44:55.921 --> 01:45:02.594
Honey, honey, honey. Seo-yeon! - Our baby's not here. - Don't worry. She's fine.


01:45:03.095 --> 01:45:04.471
I found the baby.


01:45:06.098 --> 01:45:09.017
You found her? You really found the baby?


01:45:10.143 --> 01:45:11.520
Really?


01:45:11.770 --> 01:45:13.230
Are you alright?


01:45:14.273 --> 01:45:17.025
You found the baby...


01:46:03.989 --> 01:46:05.282
Young-eun!


01:46:05.908 --> 01:46:07.492
Young-eun, come down.


01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:11.371
Young-eun, come down.


01:46:13.498 --> 01:46:16.710
Come down first and let's talk. Young-eun!


01:46:33.519 --> 01:46:34.895
Young-eun!


01:46:46.949 --> 01:46:48.617
Come down first and talk to me.


01:46:49.993 --> 01:46:51.787
Hold my hands.


01:46:53.038 --> 01:46:54.289
Young-eun.


01:47:12.057 --> 01:47:13.725
Young-eun, hold my hands.


01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:16.520
Hurry up.


01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:23.861
I was just your toy?


01:47:25.571 --> 01:47:27.656
Did you play with me?


01:47:30.742 --> 01:47:34.496
Did you like I acted cheap?


01:47:37.958 --> 01:47:39.751
Young-eun, it was not like that.


01:47:40.961 --> 01:47:42.254
Come here.


01:47:48.302 --> 01:47:50.596
But your heart was pounding.


01:47:52.514 --> 01:47:53.974
You remember, right?


01:47:58.353 --> 01:47:59.771
Young-eun.


01:48:00.272 --> 01:48:01.857
Young-eun.


01:48:02.608 --> 01:48:05.110
Hold my hands, please.


01:48:09.239 --> 01:48:11.700
Your heart is pounding too right now.


01:48:13.243 --> 01:48:15.329
You love me.


01:48:16.955 --> 01:48:18.332
Don't you?


01:48:32.304 --> 01:48:33.805
Young-eun...


01:48:38.602 --> 01:48:39.978
Young-eun.


01:48:43.732 --> 01:48:45.400
Hold my hands tight.


01:48:54.284 --> 01:48:55.953
Honey, let go of her hands.


01:48:57.454 --> 01:48:59.122
Seo-yeon, help me.


01:49:00.916 --> 01:49:03.210
She'll be obsessed over you.


01:49:08.465 --> 01:49:11.677
She will never let you go. Seo-yeon!


01:49:13.846 --> 01:49:15.722
Let go of her hands.


01:49:16.723 --> 01:49:18.642
Help me, please.


01:49:25.691 --> 01:49:27.359
Young-eun, please.


01:49:29.361 --> 01:49:34.032
What was it if it wasn't love?


01:49:41.081 --> 01:49:42.583
Young-eun...


01:49:46.044 --> 01:49:47.504
Then what...


01:49:50.215 --> 01:49:54.386
What are we for?


01:50:06.565 --> 01:50:07.858
Young-eun...


01:50:08.817 --> 01:50:10.777
Young-eun...


01:50:54.613 --> 01:50:56.907
We didn't do anything.


01:50:57.533 --> 01:50:59.326
She fell down alone.


01:51:01.954 --> 01:51:04.456
You were holding her hands till the end.


01:51:06.083 --> 01:51:12.840
I had no choice... But you were holding her really tight.


01:52:09.605 --> 01:52:11.398
Oh my dear.


01:52:12.399 --> 01:52:14.067
What can I do for you?


01:52:14.610 --> 01:52:27.039
I am sorry. Please don't cry. It's fine. It's alright. No worries. It's fine.


01:52:27.664 --> 01:52:29.041
- I'll be back soon.


01:52:29.374 --> 01:52:30.751
Honey.


01:52:31.752 --> 01:52:34.922
Can you please dispose the garbage on your way out? Sure.
