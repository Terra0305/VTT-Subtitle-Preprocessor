00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:03.730
It was hard to get, being such a sensitive case.



00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.254
Going to meet him, tomorrow?

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:30.507
Yes.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.886
Say hi for me. Tell him to come by.

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:37.848
But he probably wont want to come back.

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:41.768
Thank you, Daddy.

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.563
Goo-goo-ga-ga!

00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:10.691
Stars and Moon.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.069
The baby god is here.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.697
What do you see?

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.828
Your eyes are set wide apart. You have siblings luck.

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.206
Im an only child.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.088
Thats why youre greedy.

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:37.968
Youre born with their luck, so youre lonely.

00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:39.595
Im not lonely.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:51.815
The man youre dating will be your ruin.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.526
Break up! Dump him at once, sister!

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.528
I dont have a boyfriend.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.074
I told you I cant work mornings!

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.534
Bad brother!

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.788
Spit it out!

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.124
Its dirty! Drink this!

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.252
Dad! Money!

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.671
Why you!

00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:18.342
I told you not to barge in when were working!

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:21.887
Youre Bong-sun!

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:25.474
What the hell?

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:29.436
- Do you know her? - Yes! Of course!


00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:36.276
Who are you!

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.612
Scripture says...

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:42.157
After desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:46.370
Sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.455
Amen!

00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:57.631
Righteous Heavenly Father...

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.514
Why did you come?

00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:15.107
Ye-sung?

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:16.733
Yesus?

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:19.194
Jesus?

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.037
It feels weird to be sitting than standing before the judge.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:30.455
You, too?

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.334
I didnt do anything. Why am I nervous?

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.879
Forget your dark pasts, brothers.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.297
- Amen. - Hallelujah.

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:48.974
Chief!

00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:52.728
I mean, Warden.

00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:54.605
You all havent changed.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:05.866
The Judicial Research and Training Institutes...

00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:10.037
mock trial will now begin.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.789
The prosecution may proceed.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:19.880
Defendant Lee Yong-gu abducted young Choi Ji-young...,
sexually abused her, and killed her with a brick.

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:27.095
Everything has been proven by proper officials.

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:31.016
I believe this case is not fit for a retrial whatsoever.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.144
Thank you.

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.105
The defense may proceed.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.572
The prosecutions claim of proven evidence...

00:06:46.532 --> 00:06:50.327
that is the biggest error to this case.

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:53.163
Your Honor, the defense speaks in contempt...

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:54.456
Error?

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.582
Yes, Your Honor.

00:06:56.124 --> 00:07:01.046
The prosecution is not the one who was assigned to this case.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.799
Contrary to other cases...
the evidence and records must all be re-investigated.

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:11.056
But the prosecution seeks a ruling

00:07:11.557 --> 00:07:14.309
by taking fabricated records and false testimonies only.

00:07:17.855 --> 00:07:22.651
Then, were you the one in charge of defense back then?

00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:26.196
Were you?

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.534
No, I was not.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.079
No further questions.

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:35.581
But!

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.334
I was there.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.839
That is a clear fact.

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:48.719
You were there?

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:50.262
Yes.

00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:53.974
I was there.

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:56.935
Your Honor.

00:07:57.603 --> 00:08:03.233
Everything Im about to say is nothing but the truth.

00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:06.236
Fighting evil by moonlight

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:09.698
Winning love by daylight

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.701
Never running from a real fight

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:16.371
She is the one name Sailor Moon

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:21.502
In the name of justice, I will punish you!

00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:24.922
Theres only one left.

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.133
Ye-sung?

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:29.384
We can buy it, tomorrow!

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:30.636
Its payday?

00:08:30.636 --> 00:08:32.179
Yes!

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.556
638.80.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.308
Were rich!

00:08:36.308 --> 00:08:37.601
Yes! Were rich!

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:42.731
- Daddy! The bag! - Thats Ye-sungs...

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.650
Its Ye-sungs!

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.945
- This is Ye-sungs! - What?

00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:51.156
- Sailor Moon bag! - Whats with him?

00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:53.033
Who are you?

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.787
We came for this every day.

00:08:56.787 --> 00:08:59.623
Sometimes we came twice!

00:08:59.623 --> 00:09:03.293
Yes. Sometimes twice. Twice.

00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:07.297
- So pretty! Its Ye-sungs! - Dont touch her!

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.049
This is Ye-sungs!

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.260
- Who are you! - This is Ye-sungs!

00:09:11.969 --> 00:09:13.512
Dont hit my daddy!

00:09:13.512 --> 00:09:16.014
- Are you crazy? - This is Ye-sungs!

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:17.683
How dare you!

00:09:17.683 --> 00:09:19.893
- Sir! Please, sir. - Ill report you to the police!

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:27.401
She is the one named Sailor Moon

00:09:30.863 --> 00:09:34.575
Daddy? Why dont other stores sell it around here?

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.539
Daddy will buy it. Sailor Moon bag.

00:09:41.123 --> 00:09:43.292
For your first day of school.

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:44.960
Its okay.

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.296
Its okay.

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.507
Dont strain yourself.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:54.594
Dont strain yourself.

00:09:54.553 --> 00:09:55.846
Dont copy me.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.973
Dont copy me.

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:02.561
Okay! Stop tickling! Stop!

00:10:13.322 --> 00:10:14.907
- Daddy? - Huh?

00:10:14.907 --> 00:10:16.909
Dont drink tap water.

00:10:16.909 --> 00:10:20.370
No tap water. Boiled water.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:24.625
Dont eat snacks for lunch. Have proper food.

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:25.709
Okay?

00:10:26.877 --> 00:10:30.214
Have proper food, too. Okay?

00:10:30.214 --> 00:10:31.340
Okay.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.299
Ye-sungs cold.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.302
Ye-sung go inside.

00:10:38.514 --> 00:10:39.640
One...

00:10:40.516 --> 00:10:41.767
Two...

00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:42.642
Three!

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.236
See you, Daddy!

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.376
This way.

00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:09.044
Please wait.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:12.965
One,

00:11:13.507 --> 00:11:15.968
two, three...

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:23.350
Mister?

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.352
- Did you buy the bag? - Hi!

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:27.896
The bag.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:29.773
Sailor Moon!

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.359
Another store sells this.

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.444
Sailor Moon! I must buy it!

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:35.779
Ill buy.

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.157
Mister! Come on!

00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:41.159
Wait for me.

00:11:41.994 --> 00:11:43.287
Its over there!

00:11:43.996 --> 00:11:45.122
Pretty.

00:11:46.582 --> 00:11:47.541
Sailor Moon!

00:11:50.002 --> 00:11:51.962
Stop playing.

00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:54.131
Sailor Moon bag! Pretty.

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.641
Its cold...

00:12:11.857 --> 00:12:13.025
Oh my!

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.117
Help! Help!

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:23.327
Dont go!

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:25.913
Help!

00:12:47.518 --> 00:12:50.270
Captain! Its packed here!

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.605
Come quick, sir!

00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:55.067
The Commissioner General is coming, too!

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:57.903
Hurry over!

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:01.573
I must go home. Goodbye.

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:04.660
Sit down. Get with the picture!

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.662
- Ye-sung is waiting alone. - Okay.

00:13:06.662 --> 00:13:07.913
No comment.

00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:10.749
- Ye-sung is scared. - I know. Sit down!

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:12.876
Stupid son of a bitch!

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:15.712
Dont hit the guy!

00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:17.422
Why hit him!

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:22.427
- Sit down! - Goodbye. I must go home.

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:23.762
Get him!

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:25.973
Film it!

00:13:28.684 --> 00:13:29.601
Hold still!

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.396
Stay still!

00:13:58.589 --> 00:13:59.923
This murder is...

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:05.345
retaliation against the Police Commissioner.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:06.638
It is an attack...

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:07.764
Here, sir!

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.393
on the authority of the national police!

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:16.690
The culprit is about to arrive for a re-enactment here.

00:14:17.608 --> 00:14:18.858
A big crowd...

00:14:19.568 --> 00:14:21.278
The culprit has just arrived!

00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:22.946
Its packed here. Lets go!

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:24.698
Hes getting out of the van!

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.576
Let me interview him!

00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:31.079
Move!

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.252
You bastard!

00:14:42.508 --> 00:14:46.553
Lee is here to re-enact the crime.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.222
The murder is being re-enacted!

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:52.100
- Do it in one go. - Sit down.

00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:57.814
- You strangled her! - Pushed her down?

00:14:57.814 --> 00:14:59.233
Slapped her cheeks!

00:14:59.233 --> 00:15:00.442
Kissed her!

00:15:05.364 --> 00:15:06.490
What next?

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:09.868
Stripped her?

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:12.955
Like this for blood circulation.

00:15:12.955 --> 00:15:14.873
I see.

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:17.251
Take your pants off, too!

00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:19.419
- Not the pants! - Do it!

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.504
Thats embarrassing.

00:15:20.504 --> 00:15:22.506
Finish quick and go see your daughter.

00:15:22.506 --> 00:15:24.924
- Ye-sung. - Right. Ye-sung!

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:28.095
Finish up to go see Ye-sung!

00:15:28.095 --> 00:15:30.305
Thats good.

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:34.226
You bastard!

00:15:38.647 --> 00:15:39.731
Who are you!

00:15:41.567 --> 00:15:42.568
Daddy!

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.528
Daddy!

00:15:46.864 --> 00:15:47.906
Daddy!

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:50.951
Ye-sung!

00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:51.827
Daddy!

00:15:51.827 --> 00:15:53.078
Ye-sung!

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:56.415
Ye-sung!

00:15:58.625 --> 00:15:59.793
Daddy!

00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:01.753
Daddy!

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.465
Daddy!

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.134
- Ye-sung! - Daddy!

00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:11.221
- Daddy! - Ye-sung!

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:12.514
Daddy!

00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:16.560
Daddy!

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.688
Stay at home! See you soon!

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:21.148
Daddy, dont go!

00:16:21.148 --> 00:16:22.441
Ill be home soon!

00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:23.901
- Daddy! - Ye-sung!

00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:24.984
Ye-sung!

00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:26.111
Daddy!

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:27.821
Youll catch a cold!

00:26:30.174 --> 00:26:31.300

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.359

00:27:06.835 --> 00:27:07.878

00:27:08.754 --> 00:27:09.838
Smoking is bad.

00:27:09.838 --> 00:27:10.881

You dont know our boss.

If you dont keep your word, youre just a thug!

00:27:22.518 --> 00:27:27.105
But a real gangster sticks to his word, like our boss.

00:27:27.105 --> 00:27:28.690
You get my meaning?

00:27:29.942 --> 00:27:34.530

They picked 3 kids. Arent they cute?

00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:34.673

Ye-sung. Hold on.

00:29:13.962 --> 00:29:16.215

- Thank you! - Okay. Quiet.

00:30:59.902 --> 00:31:02.613
- This is wrong, boss! - Thank you.

00:31:02.946 --> 00:31:04.990
Think! What if we get caught?

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:10.662
This can increase our sentences!

00:31:10.662 --> 00:31:13.749

Daddy is not a bad man.

00:33:23.337 --> 00:33:27.382
This is a school. Not a bad place.

00:33:27.382 --> 00:33:28.592
Drink this.

00:33:29.134 --> 00:33:32.596
Not school. Its prison.

00:33:33.805 --> 00:33:35.098
All bad people.

00:33:35.807 --> 00:33:38.769
Daddy didnt do bad.

00:33:44.274 --> 00:33:47.361

00:34:13.387 --> 00:34:17.266
- Go on! Hurry! - Yes. Goodbye.

00:34:18.016 --> 00:34:20.394
Not you! Ye-sung!

00:34:20.394 --> 00:34:22.104
- No! - No!

00:34:23.981 --> 00:34:25.440
Listen to me in my cell!

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.483
Hey!

00:34:26.483 --> 00:34:27.943
Shut up!

00:34:28.986 --> 00:34:32.070
If you dont go out now, you gotta keep hiding.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.366
Then, you cant see your dad again!

00:34:34.867 --> 00:34:36.577
Quiet down!

00:34:38.036 --> 00:34:38.829
Daddy?

00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:42.040
Cant I stay here? No one knows.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.668
Yes. No one knows.

00:34:44.668 --> 00:34:46.170
But you have to go to school.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.631
You cant skip school. Come back on a holiday.

00:34:49.631 --> 00:34:51.758
He said, this was school!

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:56.763
Not school. Its prison. All bad people.

00:34:56.763 --> 00:34:58.724
So, she should go to school!

00:34:58.724 --> 00:35:00.475
Want her to become like me?

00:35:00.475 --> 00:35:01.518
Or him!

00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:04.813
Or him?

00:35:04.813 --> 00:35:05.731
The hell!

00:35:05.939 --> 00:35:06.773
Or you?

00:35:06.773 --> 00:35:07.900
Stupid!

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:13.238
Ye-sung must go to school.

00:35:13.864 --> 00:35:14.698
Come play again.

00:35:14.698 --> 00:35:17.367
No way! This isnt a playground!

00:35:19.244 --> 00:35:21.997
Uncle 1004 will bring you back.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:24.583
See you later.

00:35:27.002 --> 00:35:28.170
Promise!

00:35:31.006 --> 00:35:32.758
Promise her!

00:35:32.758 --> 00:35:34.134
Right. I promise.

00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:38.555
What the hell!

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:43.060
Why invite a pastor about to croak!

00:35:43.936 --> 00:35:45.229
We can get hanged!

00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:07.125
- Eat up. - Okay.

00:36:10.838 --> 00:36:12.381
What the hell!

00:36:15.175 --> 00:36:18.554
How can you eat? Is it good?

00:36:18.554 --> 00:36:19.721
Its good.

00:36:20.514 --> 00:36:22.140
- Right? - Yeah.

00:36:23.016 --> 00:36:26.061
Ye-sung must eat beans. Lots of vitamins.

00:36:26.061 --> 00:36:28.230
I dont want beans.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.898
You have to! Open wide!

00:36:29.898 --> 00:36:31.984
Then, whyd you come here?

00:36:32.693 --> 00:36:35.195
The kid is eating more than our share!

00:36:37.906 --> 00:36:40.242
Boss! What now!

00:36:40.826 --> 00:36:45.122
Its easy to take things in, but hard to let em go.

00:36:45.122 --> 00:36:47.875
Cut the crap, Gramps!

00:36:48.458 --> 00:36:50.711
- Eat lots. - Boss?

00:36:50.711 --> 00:36:52.504
Lets fess up, boss.

00:36:52.504 --> 00:36:53.881
Lets fess up!

00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:56.550
If we do, whod forgive us?

00:37:03.557 --> 00:37:06.143
- Ye-sung needs to poo? - Yup.

00:37:06.143 --> 00:37:07.686
Poop.

00:37:09.605 --> 00:37:12.274
Eating and pooping, too!

00:37:12.441 --> 00:37:14.610
What the hell!

00:37:17.279 --> 00:37:18.280
Lets eat.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.533
- Close the door! - Push!

00:37:27.539 --> 00:37:30.417
Lets send her out in two days.

00:37:30.417 --> 00:37:33.045
- Why then? - Whats in two days?

00:37:33.045 --> 00:37:36.131
- A religious event. - Its the day He came.

00:37:36.131 --> 00:37:38.675
Chun-ho, youre good.

00:37:39.343 --> 00:37:41.220
A clever conman.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.430
It wasnt a con!

00:37:44.598 --> 00:37:46.558
- Its a treasure ship! - Gather around!

00:37:48.018 --> 00:37:51.021
Sneak her out in two days. Okay?

00:37:51.021 --> 00:37:51.688
Okay!

00:37:51.688 --> 00:37:53.273
Okay? For what?

00:37:53.273 --> 00:37:56.902
Why do you always huddle and mumble stuff?

00:37:56.902 --> 00:37:59.655
Dont huddle around! Got that?

00:37:59.655 --> 00:38:01.365
Yes, sir!

00:38:01.365 --> 00:38:02.324
Okay.

00:38:05.494 --> 00:38:08.664
Monica. I had a rough day.

00:38:09.623 --> 00:38:12.876
Sleep well. See you in my dream.

00:38:14.002 --> 00:38:17.464
Man-beom. Lets sleep.

00:38:25.597 --> 00:38:31.019
Sorry. Its cause I wanted the Sailor Moon bag.

00:38:31.019 --> 00:38:34.273
Ill buy Sailor Moon bag.

00:38:34.273 --> 00:38:38.819
Tell the judge clear and straight.

00:38:38.819 --> 00:38:42.656
Clear and straight.

00:38:42.656 --> 00:38:45.409
That youre not a bad person.

00:38:46.368 --> 00:38:48.161
Daddys not a bad person.

00:38:53.458 --> 00:38:56.128
So pretty!

00:38:56.128 --> 00:38:57.546
Ye-sung is pretty.

00:38:58.172 --> 00:39:01.550
No, there! The stars and moon!

00:39:07.264 --> 00:39:08.182
Pretty.

00:39:17.316 --> 00:39:18.025
Boss!

00:39:19.776 --> 00:39:22.446
- Boss! - Ye-sung!

00:39:22.446 --> 00:39:23.822
Ye-sung!

00:39:25.574 --> 00:39:26.992
- The bathcell! - Not there!

00:39:26.992 --> 00:39:27.868
Ye-sung!

00:39:28.368 --> 00:39:30.329
No! Not there!

00:39:38.253 --> 00:39:39.338
Jesus Christ!

00:39:41.715 --> 00:39:42.925
What brings you here?

00:39:43.509 --> 00:39:45.219
What was that sound?

00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:48.222
What sound? Sleep talking?

00:39:48.222 --> 00:39:50.891
I heard a girls voice!

00:39:50.891 --> 00:39:52.851
A girls voice? Come on.

00:39:54.186 --> 00:39:55.437
Youre scaring us.

00:39:55.437 --> 00:39:57.356
I heard a girls voice! I swear!

00:39:57.981 --> 00:39:59.691
I wish I had a girl.

00:39:59.691 --> 00:40:01.985
Said stars and moon!

00:40:01.985 --> 00:40:03.654
Oh...him?

00:40:04.905 --> 00:40:06.073
Him what?

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:09.034
Answer me now!

00:40:09.993 --> 00:40:11.161
Whats this?

00:40:11.828 --> 00:40:14.456
Stars and Moon!

00:40:16.542 --> 00:40:18.919
Of all the crazy things...

00:40:18.919 --> 00:40:22.840
Just go back to sleep!

00:40:28.887 --> 00:40:30.389
- Chun-ho? - What?

00:40:30.389 --> 00:40:32.015
This is serious!

00:40:32.641 --> 00:40:34.434
- Whats that? - Monica!

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:39.815
Who! What! This is my favorite picture!

00:40:39.815 --> 00:40:42.526
Why! Ye-sung! Why!

00:40:42.526 --> 00:40:44.903
She looked cold, so I dressed her.

00:40:44.903 --> 00:40:49.366
- Cold? I dont believe this! - Thats a violation of his rights!

00:40:49.366 --> 00:40:52.661
- Ye-sung? Who is that girl? - Shes Sailor Moon!

00:40:53.787 --> 00:40:54.705
Sailor Moon?

00:40:54.705 --> 00:40:56.623
- Sailor Moon? - Whos Sailor Moon?

00:40:56.623 --> 00:40:58.083
What the...

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.212
In the name of justice! I will punish you!

00:41:02.462 --> 00:41:03.964
So scary!

00:41:03.964 --> 00:41:06.175
The judges say that!

00:41:06.175 --> 00:41:08.594
- Then, Judge Moon? - Judge Moon.

00:41:09.219 --> 00:41:11.346
Dont you know this song?

00:41:12.014 --> 00:41:15.642
She will never turn her back on her friends

00:41:15.642 --> 00:41:19.229
She is always there to defend

00:41:19.229 --> 00:41:21.231
She is the one on whom we can depend

00:41:21.231 --> 00:41:23.400
- Quiet! - Sit down!

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.236
She is the one named Sailor Moon

00:41:26.236 --> 00:41:27.362
Whats with him!

00:41:27.362 --> 00:41:28.739
With secret powers all so new to her...

00:41:28.739 --> 00:41:31.241
Stop it! Sit down!

00:41:32.659 --> 00:41:33.994
Sit down!

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.871
Sit!

00:41:35.871 --> 00:41:39.416
She is the one named Sailor Moon

00:41:39.416 --> 00:41:43.837
With secret powers all so new to her

00:41:43.837 --> 00:41:45.589
Hello, sir!

00:41:46.131 --> 00:41:49.801
She is the one named Sailor Moon

00:41:49.801 --> 00:41:51.970
Stay down!

00:41:52.721 --> 00:41:55.933
Fighting evil by moonlight

00:41:55.933 --> 00:41:59.311
Winning love by daylight

00:41:59.311 --> 00:42:02.064
Never running from a real fight

00:42:02.064 --> 00:42:04.816
- Perfect! Hallelujah! - Amen!

00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:19.831
I warned you to be careful with my lace briefs!

00:42:19.831 --> 00:42:23.669
She will never turn her back on a friend

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:30.384
Okay.

00:42:36.348 --> 00:42:37.558
Ye-sung?

00:42:37.558 --> 00:42:39.768
Study hard. Take care!

00:42:40.561 --> 00:42:42.187
Amen! Amen!

00:42:42.187 --> 00:42:43.272
Go on.

00:42:51.947 --> 00:42:53.031
What?

00:42:59.663 --> 00:43:00.622
The hell?

00:43:06.128 --> 00:43:08.672
Why the monks!

00:43:16.346 --> 00:43:19.808
Cant tell from Buddha and Jesus!

00:43:21.768 --> 00:43:22.811
How embarrassing!

00:43:22.811 --> 00:43:24.438
Dont hit!

00:43:24.438 --> 00:43:27.191
Youre scaring her.

00:43:27.191 --> 00:43:28.567
Get out now!

00:43:28.567 --> 00:43:29.401
- I cant! - Come out now!

00:43:29.401 --> 00:43:32.654
- Im your right hand man! - Like hell!

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.157
Chief?

00:43:35.157 --> 00:43:36.742
Can you choose a picture?

00:43:36.742 --> 00:43:38.994
What do I know about pictures?

00:43:39.453 --> 00:43:40.954
Still, sir.

00:43:42.122 --> 00:43:43.790
- Let me see. - Yes, sir.

00:43:44.875 --> 00:43:45.918
Here.

00:43:50.756 --> 00:43:52.883
Hows the pastor?

00:43:52.883 --> 00:43:55.761
- Hes feeling better. - Thats good.

00:44:09.066 --> 00:44:11.318
Brainless conman!

00:44:11.318 --> 00:44:13.612
Think it over, boss.

00:44:13.612 --> 00:44:15.364
They search ten times a day!

00:44:15.364 --> 00:44:18.450
What if they suddenly come in?

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:19.743
Then what?

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.873
You shouldve shaved her head and sent her out!

00:44:24.873 --> 00:44:28.710
No! Ye-sungs hair is pretty.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:29.878
Pretty hair.

00:44:29.878 --> 00:44:31.588
Pretty, my ass!

00:44:38.512 --> 00:44:39.888
Ye-sung!

00:44:40.722 --> 00:44:41.974
Stay still.

00:44:45.435 --> 00:44:46.395
Bastards.

00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:50.899
Why arent you sleeping?

00:44:52.526 --> 00:44:53.861
Did you have dinner, sir?

00:44:53.861 --> 00:44:55.362
Of course.

00:44:55.863 --> 00:44:57.281
We just ate too, sir.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.076
Stay still, Yong-gu.

00:45:01.076 --> 00:45:03.620
- It was good. - Really?

00:45:04.413 --> 00:45:05.956
I liked it, too.

00:45:41.909 --> 00:45:45.078
She was there for 2 days and no one knew?

00:45:45.078 --> 00:45:46.830
I knew, sir!

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:50.209
I heard a girls voice saying, Stars and Moon.

00:45:51.376 --> 00:45:53.462
Search through all the cells!

00:45:53.795 --> 00:45:56.965
- Yes, sir! - Ye-sung! Wheres Ye-sung?

00:45:56.965 --> 00:45:59.301
I put the child in the staff cell.

00:45:59.301 --> 00:46:01.720
Crazy! Send her out now!

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.430
But its raining, sir.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:04.681
Want to get fired!

00:46:06.016 --> 00:46:07.184
Yes, sir.

00:46:07.184 --> 00:46:10.103
Its raining a lot! Ye-sung will catch a cold!

00:46:10.103 --> 00:46:11.605
- A cold? - Yes.

00:46:11.605 --> 00:46:13.815
How can you say that!

00:46:14.274 --> 00:46:16.735
Ye-sung doesnt have an umbrella!

00:46:18.987 --> 00:46:21.865
You kill a girl and worry about your daughter!

00:46:25.953 --> 00:46:31.083
5482 didnt kill a girl.

00:46:36.672 --> 00:46:37.756
Boss?

00:46:37.756 --> 00:46:41.844
If we stay low, maybe theyll let us off.

00:46:41.844 --> 00:46:43.053
Shut up!

00:46:43.554 --> 00:46:44.179
Yes, sir.

00:46:44.179 --> 00:46:48.934
If we talk, some guards could get fired.

00:46:48.934 --> 00:46:50.686
We cant lose.

00:46:51.854 --> 00:46:55.399
Right! Were in the same boat as the guards.

00:46:55.399 --> 00:46:58.026
Its a joint operation.

00:46:58.443 --> 00:47:00.737
So smart.

00:47:01.238 --> 00:47:05.951
Joint operation? I like the sound of that.

00:47:06.743 --> 00:47:09.746
Ye-sungs father probably got solitary, right?

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.500
Put em down.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.711
Put your arms up, now!

00:47:15.711 --> 00:47:17.421
After how nice I treated you!

00:47:17.421 --> 00:47:20.299
- Come on, sir. - Dont suck up to me now!

00:47:25.012 --> 00:47:27.472

00:49:54.494 --> 00:49:56.622
You stopped my dad from visiting!

00:49:56.622 --> 00:49:58.999
Ill call your father if you put that down!

00:50:02.836 --> 00:50:05.214
I want to see my dad!

00:50:05.214 --> 00:50:07.424

Okay, fine! Ill put it down.

Thanks, Chief.

00:50:16.308 --> 00:50:17.935
Thought Id say that?

00:50:17.935 --> 00:50:21.396
Screw you! Im an orphan! Bastards!

00:50:52.344 --> 00:50:53.971
Come out, fool!

00:50:53.971 --> 00:50:56.598
- You wanna die! - Stay back!

00:50:56.598 --> 00:50:57.599
Or youre dead!

00:51:04.398 --> 00:51:06.149
Stay back! Bastard!

00:51:06.149 --> 00:51:07.401
Dont come near me!

00:51:10.654 --> 00:51:12.114
Theres someone there!

00:51:12.114 --> 00:51:13.782
Someones there!

00:51:13.782 --> 00:51:16.994
- Someones there! - Move!

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:21.373
Someone needs help!

00:51:54.448 --> 00:51:56.200
Come to your senses?

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.493
Oh man.

00:51:59.369 --> 00:52:00.746
What happened?

00:52:00.746 --> 00:52:04.082
You were damn lucky. Thats what.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.296
If it wasnt for the weirdo, you couldve had a funeral.

00:52:11.131 --> 00:52:12.090
Who?

00:52:18.055 --> 00:52:22.476
He mustve took in a lot of gas carrying you out.

00:52:23.227 --> 00:52:25.562
But he cried like crazy...

00:52:25.562 --> 00:52:29.066
and begged me to save you.

00:52:30.651 --> 00:52:34.446
Is he really a kidnapper?

00:52:35.239 --> 00:52:37.157
He wasnt the one abducted?

00:52:40.536 --> 00:52:45.958
How I wonder what you are

00:52:46.375 --> 00:52:52.464
Up above the world so high

00:52:52.464 --> 00:52:54.216
Like a...

00:52:55.133 --> 00:52:56.510
Hello.

00:53:03.141 --> 00:53:05.143
- Take care. - Bye, Ms. Lee.

00:53:11.441 --> 00:53:12.276
Ye-sung?

00:53:15.279 --> 00:53:18.407
I was so worried about you.

00:53:18.824 --> 00:53:22.160
No one was living at your address.

00:53:23.203 --> 00:53:24.830
Did you move?

00:53:29.376 --> 00:53:30.711
Were you sick?

00:53:34.798 --> 00:53:38.385
I wish you can tell me what happened.

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:42.556
Can you ask my daddy?

00:53:43.348 --> 00:53:44.516
What?

00:53:44.516 --> 00:53:45.934
Parent consultation?

00:53:49.438 --> 00:53:50.689
Oh, right.

00:53:50.772 --> 00:53:53.066
You have ID, right?

00:53:54.943 --> 00:53:56.236

00:54:07.372 --> 00:54:08.582
Daddy!

00:54:13.712 --> 00:54:14.796

00:54:15.714 --> 00:54:16.965

00:54:17.508 --> 00:54:19.801
- Daddy! - Ye-sung!

00:54:19.801 --> 00:54:23.138
Did you catch a cold?

00:54:23.138 --> 00:54:24.640
Im all better now.

00:54:26.433 --> 00:54:27.726
Ye-sung is skinny.

00:54:27.726 --> 00:54:29.144
You, too.

00:54:29.144 --> 00:54:32.481
Daddy is okay. Ye-sung...

00:54:33.899 --> 00:54:35.526
This is my teacher.

00:54:37.819 --> 00:54:39.738
- Hello. - Hello.

00:54:40.531 --> 00:54:42.032
Please sit.

00:54:45.327 --> 00:54:49.790
Nice to meet you. Im Ye-sungs teacher.

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:50.916
So pretty.

00:54:52.793 --> 00:54:54.127
Ye-sung is pretty, too.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:56.255
Teacher is pretty, too.

00:54:57.381 --> 00:54:59.800
Nothings wrong.

00:55:00.926 --> 00:55:03.387
Its just a parent consultation.

00:55:03.387 --> 00:55:05.138
Ye-sung is smart!

00:55:05.138 --> 00:55:08.183
She pays bills herself!

00:55:08.183 --> 00:55:09.560
First day of every month.

00:55:10.394 --> 00:55:14.398
From my monthly salary, 638.80...

00:55:14.398 --> 00:55:18.443
she puts 170 into savings.

00:55:18.443 --> 00:55:20.404
Pays health insurance on the 10th.

00:55:20.404 --> 00:55:21.446
Health insurance is...

00:55:21.446 --> 00:55:23.073
5.50!

00:55:23.073 --> 00:55:26.326
Right! 5.50!

00:55:26.326 --> 00:55:28.245
I see.

00:55:28.245 --> 00:55:33.625
Ye-sung is the smartest and prettiest student in our class.

00:55:33.625 --> 00:55:38.964
- Ye-sung is the prettiest! - Ye-sung sings very well, too.

00:55:38.964 --> 00:55:42.092
Maybe she could join the school choir?

00:55:42.092 --> 00:55:43.177
Great!

00:55:45.012 --> 00:55:46.346
Bottom shelf of fridge?

00:55:46.346 --> 00:55:47.306
Pickled beans.

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:49.474
Top shelf of fridge?

00:55:49.474 --> 00:55:52.227
Pickled radish from our neighbor.

00:55:53.645 --> 00:55:54.688
On top of the fridge?

00:55:54.688 --> 00:55:57.524
Instant noodles. Boil water for 3 minutes.

00:55:58.192 --> 00:55:59.401
Put an egg in.

00:55:59.401 --> 00:56:00.777
Okay!

00:56:00.777 --> 00:56:02.571
Daddy...

00:56:04.573 --> 00:56:08.368

00:56:13.498 --> 00:56:15.042
Ye-sung!

00:56:15.042 --> 00:56:17.961
Daddy? Daddy!

00:56:18.504 --> 00:56:19.963
Whats happening?

00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:22.007
Ye-sung! Eat lots!

00:56:22.007 --> 00:56:23.800
Youre skinny! Eat beans!

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.760
Youre skinny, too!

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.596
- Eat beans! Vitamin! - You too, Daddy!

00:56:27.596 --> 00:56:28.680
Ye-sung!

00:56:31.225 --> 00:56:34.937
Ill be home soon!

00:56:34.937 --> 00:56:37.606
- Wait for me at home! - When are you coming?

00:56:37.606 --> 00:56:41.693
Ill be home soon!

00:56:41.693 --> 00:56:43.362

00:56:43.362 --> 00:56:44.655

00:56:44.655 --> 00:56:47.115

00:56:47.115 --> 00:56:48.325

00:56:48.325 --> 00:56:53.080
See you soon, Ye-sung!

00:57:27.364 --> 00:57:31.034
We get sunlight once a day. Dont sit here like this.

00:57:33.787 --> 00:57:36.123
Get up and exercise.

00:57:36.123 --> 00:57:37.416
Youll get sick.

00:57:44.381 --> 00:57:50.053
Lee Yong-gus daughter is in the hospital.

00:57:52.723 --> 00:57:54.391
She wont eat anything.

00:57:55.434 --> 00:57:57.311
I knew this would happen.

00:57:58.937 --> 00:58:01.523
We can no longer take care of her.

00:58:03.525 --> 00:58:07.571
A countryside orphanage would have funds to take her.

00:58:16.788 --> 00:58:18.040
Mister?

00:58:21.168 --> 00:58:24.254
I dont want to go far away.

00:58:27.216 --> 00:58:31.553
Cant you just arrest me, too?

00:58:33.722 --> 00:58:34.723
Please?

00:58:44.691 --> 00:58:48.278
Chief, I think this is a mistake.

00:58:48.278 --> 00:58:49.571
This is wrong.

00:58:49.571 --> 00:58:51.031
Hell take responsibility.

00:58:51.031 --> 00:58:53.992
So what! Well all get fired!

00:58:53.992 --> 00:58:57.534
- Im going to farm. - What?

00:58:57.454 --> 00:58:58.705
Come farm with me.

00:58:59.373 --> 00:59:00.332

00:59:00.791 --> 00:59:03.377
Chief! Chief!

00:59:04.837 --> 00:59:06.547

00:59:23.397 --> 00:59:25.107
CHO-KER

00:59:25.107 --> 00:59:27.776
Acting all smart!

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:53.010
HOMETOWN RICE CAKES

00:59:54.178 --> 00:59:57.222
Is today a special day? Why the rice cakes?

00:59:57.222 --> 01:00:01.393
Its especially for cell no.7 while the warden is away.

01:00:02.519 --> 01:00:03.600
Ye-sung.

01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:09.606
- It says, rice cakes. - Its Ye-sung.

01:00:09.526 --> 01:00:11.195
You say that over every box.

01:00:11.195 --> 01:00:12.154
Lets eat.

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:14.031

01:00:15.324 --> 01:00:16.450

Stupid! Its not rice cakes!

01:00:28.378 --> 01:00:29.338
Chief?

01:00:30.255 --> 01:00:33.175
Did he go to the staff cell?

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:36.512
Yong-gu? Wait here, please.

01:00:36.512 --> 01:00:37.638
Yes.

01:00:39.515 --> 01:00:42.059
Where did he go?

01:01:07.084 --> 01:01:08.418
What are you doing?

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.380
Hello, sir.

01:01:13.632 --> 01:01:14.883
Put that down.

01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:22.724
Cookies are tasty.

01:01:27.104 --> 01:01:28.063
Get out.

01:01:33.235 --> 01:01:35.821
I didnt bring Ye-sung for you.

01:01:35.821 --> 01:01:36.822

01:01:43.871 --> 01:01:44.580
Leave!

01:01:45.247 --> 01:01:46.081

01:01:46.665 --> 01:01:48.083
Take care, sir.

01:01:52.713 --> 01:01:53.714

01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:56.967
Whyd you kill her?

01:02:03.307 --> 01:02:05.559
You read it, Uncle.

01:02:05.559 --> 01:02:08.562
You have the best voice here.

01:02:09.021 --> 01:02:14.526
We even get to see you read thanks to Ye-sung.

01:02:14.526 --> 01:02:18.864
Never saw him read once in 7 years together.

01:02:18.989 --> 01:02:20.240
Please?

01:02:21.909 --> 01:02:23.410
Lets see.

01:02:24.411 --> 01:02:26.955
Theres a butterfly.

01:02:28.207 --> 01:02:33.587
I had one drawn on my thigh. But I erased it with an iron.

01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:36.673
Theres one butterfly, right?

01:02:36.673 --> 01:02:38.842
Its a loner.

01:02:38.842 --> 01:02:42.012
And look! It meets a mouse.

01:02:42.012 --> 01:02:43.805
Come on, boss!

01:02:43.805 --> 01:02:47.684
Dont say stuff like loner to the kid.

01:02:47.684 --> 01:02:49.228
Its not like youre illiterate.

01:02:50.687 --> 01:02:52.231
Come on.

01:02:52.397 --> 01:02:54.608
Who cant read these days?

01:02:55.192 --> 01:02:57.277
- That makes no sense. - Fine. Keep playing.

01:02:58.779 --> 01:03:03.780
Even chimpanzees can learn to read in 3 months!

01:03:03.742 --> 01:03:04.993
Okay! Fine!

01:03:07.746 --> 01:03:10.749
A fool who cant read aint no human!

01:03:10.749 --> 01:03:13.293
Know what the illiteracy rate is?

01:03:13.293 --> 01:03:17.881
Theres no one like that here! Get your facts straight!

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:18.632
Okay, fine.

01:03:18.632 --> 01:03:22.052
Who doesnt know how to read? Thats crazy!

01:03:22.052 --> 01:03:24.847
Fine! Dont get excited and play!

01:03:24.847 --> 01:03:26.390
Im not in the mood!

01:03:27.015 --> 01:03:29.476
- Why you little! - Who cant read!

01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:34.565
On a cold winter day, a yellow butterfly came out.

01:03:34.565 --> 01:03:36.859
Sneak one in for me.

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:38.861
What?

01:03:41.154 --> 01:03:43.699
Ye-sung snuck in.

01:03:43.699 --> 01:03:45.409
So sneak in my baby, too!

01:03:46.994 --> 01:03:51.915
This isnt daycare! One kid is enough!

01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:56.170
With special amnesty gone...

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:58.297
too bad, pal.

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:00.132
Look, boss! Look!

01:04:00.132 --> 01:04:02.176
21 weeks. Itll be born soon!

01:04:02.467 --> 01:04:03.927
Read it!

01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:07.055
Im not reading! Shut up.

01:04:09.558 --> 01:04:12.477
Cant read or make kids. Like youd understand.

01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:15.105
You fools are asking for it!

01:04:16.148 --> 01:04:20.319
- Why ask him to read? - Whats with you?

01:04:20.736 --> 01:04:22.487
Want the baby in that bad?

01:04:22.487 --> 01:04:23.447
Yes!

01:04:23.447 --> 01:04:24.448
Come here.

01:04:27.034 --> 01:04:31.496
Then, get the death sentence.

01:04:34.708 --> 01:04:36.502
I should just die.

01:04:42.257 --> 01:04:45.928
Of course I remember! It was crazy!

01:04:45.928 --> 01:04:48.222
Everyone was out at dawn.

01:04:48.222 --> 01:04:51.183
The Commissioner Generals daughter died!

01:04:51.183 --> 01:04:55.604
Minister of Home Affairs ordered to wrap up the case in a week!

01:04:55.604 --> 01:04:57.523
- Captain Park? - Yes, sir?

01:04:58.065 --> 01:05:00.192
Can I see Lee Yong-gus file?

01:05:03.987 --> 01:05:05.155
No, sir.

01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:07.824
Give it to me.

01:05:09.159 --> 01:05:12.412
Sir, Im a law-abiding cop.

01:05:19.044 --> 01:05:23.924
Did Lee Yong-gu really write this?

01:05:24.758 --> 01:05:27.094
Not sure. I wasnt in charge of that.

01:05:29.096 --> 01:05:30.347
I need a copy of this.

01:05:31.348 --> 01:05:33.767
Sir! Thats impossible!

01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:37.187
Then, Ill just take it.

01:05:37.187 --> 01:05:38.647
Come on, sir!

01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:42.776
You cant! I could get fired.

01:05:45.612 --> 01:05:48.699
After everything, still dont get it?

01:05:49.533 --> 01:05:53.036
Its cuz of bastards like him your son died!

01:05:56.081 --> 01:05:59.126
Its smaller than my dads!

01:05:59.126 --> 01:06:01.461
- Is this real? - Of course its fake!

01:06:01.461 --> 01:06:02.379
Its real.

01:06:03.172 --> 01:06:04.715
Can I touch it?

01:06:05.799 --> 01:06:07.467
Dont press Send.

01:06:11.513 --> 01:06:12.848
Whats Send?

01:06:17.477 --> 01:06:21.815

01:06:26.361 --> 01:06:27.863
Thanks Young-hoon!

01:06:40.209 --> 01:06:44.838
G...r...a...p...e...s.

01:06:44.838 --> 01:06:46.965
- Thats it! - Well done!

01:06:46.965 --> 01:06:48.675
You can do it.

01:06:49.885 --> 01:06:51.261
Next, apple.

01:06:51.261 --> 01:06:53.430
Apple.

01:06:56.225 --> 01:06:58.727
- You practiced a lot. - Thats it.

01:06:58.727 --> 01:06:59.770
Good!

01:07:00.229 --> 01:07:02.397
Now, the rest.

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:05.776
You can do it.

01:07:05.776 --> 01:07:06.902
Go on.

01:07:07.236 --> 01:07:09.112
Ple as in pled.

01:07:09.112 --> 01:07:10.280
Right!

01:07:13.784 --> 01:07:17.120
Uncle! That says, ape.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.205
Stupid.

01:07:18.205 --> 01:07:20.749
Apple is a-p-p-l-e.

01:07:20.749 --> 01:07:22.793
You left out a P and L!

01:07:23.418 --> 01:07:26.255
You practiced for days! Cant even do that?

01:07:26.255 --> 01:07:28.215
P and L.

01:07:28.215 --> 01:07:30.509
- Cant remember? - Even Yong-gu knows!

01:07:30.509 --> 01:07:33.011
- P and L. - He doesnt remember!

01:07:45.274 --> 01:07:46.108
Right!

01:07:46.108 --> 01:07:47.651
Well done!

01:07:49.611 --> 01:07:50.696
Bastard!

01:07:56.285 --> 01:07:58.954
Now, you can go to school.

01:07:58.954 --> 01:08:01.039
If I knew how to read, Id be a prosecutor.

01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:07.045
Cheer up. Shell write to you soon.

01:08:09.047 --> 01:08:13.302
Its hard for women, after giving birth.

01:08:13.302 --> 01:08:16.597
No energy to write.

01:08:24.146 --> 01:08:25.147
Uncle?

01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:33.447
Whats this?

01:08:33.447 --> 01:08:34.656
Hey!

01:08:37.034 --> 01:08:38.452
Whered you get this?

01:08:38.452 --> 01:08:40.370
I borrowed it from Young-hoon.

01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:41.580
Is it a toy?

01:08:42.873 --> 01:08:44.917
We cant have it in here, but...

01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:45.959
Hurry up!

01:08:47.044 --> 01:08:48.253
Try it!

01:08:52.674 --> 01:08:53.759

01:08:59.473 --> 01:09:01.308

01:09:03.435 --> 01:09:07.439

01:09:08.148 --> 01:09:10.609
- Ye-sung? - Go by the window!

01:09:10.609 --> 01:09:11.902
The window!

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:14.613
Is it working?

01:09:14.613 --> 01:09:16.156
- Its ringing! - Yes!

01:09:16.156 --> 01:09:17.157
Hello?

01:09:17.741 --> 01:09:19.076
Hello?

01:09:19.076 --> 01:09:20.744
- Whos this? - Hello?

01:09:20.744 --> 01:09:22.037
Another prank call?

01:09:22.037 --> 01:09:24.331
Sun-nyuh? Its me!

01:09:24.331 --> 01:09:25.499
Its her!

01:09:25.499 --> 01:09:26.333
Honey?

01:09:26.333 --> 01:09:27.668
Sun-nyuh!

01:09:27.668 --> 01:09:29.461
Honey?

01:09:29.461 --> 01:09:31.088
I had the baby, honey.

01:09:31.088 --> 01:09:33.966
- Stop crying. - You stop crying.

01:09:33.966 --> 01:09:34.758
Honey!

01:09:34.758 --> 01:09:35.926
Hello?

01:09:35.926 --> 01:09:37.719
Its not working again!

01:09:39.012 --> 01:09:41.098
Quiet down or were dead!

01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:45.394
- Why isnt it working! - Hold it up higher!

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.063
Stop!

01:09:48.647 --> 01:09:51.441
Get back! Wanna get killed?

01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:52.734
Get back!

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:55.988
Shoot!

01:09:59.157 --> 01:10:01.034
Theres a signal!

01:10:01.034 --> 01:10:02.244
Its working!

01:10:02.244 --> 01:10:03.328
Can you hear me?

01:10:03.328 --> 01:10:04.872
The signals strong!

01:10:04.872 --> 01:10:06.415
The babys crying!

01:10:06.415 --> 01:10:07.749
Tell it to say, daddy!

01:10:07.749 --> 01:10:08.959
Daddy? Right!

01:10:08.959 --> 01:10:12.629
Baby? Its your daddy!

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.212
Its giggling.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.759
Is it healthy?

01:10:18.427 --> 01:10:19.803
Has all 10 fingers and toes?

01:10:19.803 --> 01:10:22.431
The baby looks like you. Fit to be a general.

01:10:22.431 --> 01:10:23.307
Really?

01:10:24.183 --> 01:10:24.933
Is it a son?

01:10:24.933 --> 01:10:26.518
Its a girl.

01:10:27.311 --> 01:10:28.478
Boss!

01:10:28.478 --> 01:10:29.563
Its a girl.

01:10:31.356 --> 01:10:32.608
A girl like me!

01:10:34.651 --> 01:10:35.903
Oh shoot.

01:10:36.195 --> 01:10:39.531
Hello? Are you...

01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:42.451
Im barely surviving, you know.

01:10:42.451 --> 01:10:45.954
I cant talk long. The batterys dying!

01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:48.540
What about the babys name?

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.334
The babys name?

01:10:51.418 --> 01:10:54.171
Put your name and hers together.

01:10:54.171 --> 01:10:55.380
What?

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.925
Its Bong-sun. Shin Bong-sun.

01:10:57.925 --> 01:11:01.261
Poor kid. Looking like her father.

01:11:01.261 --> 01:11:04.056
- I love you, honey. - I love you too.

01:11:07.684 --> 01:11:08.936
Done? Good.

01:11:10.395 --> 01:11:13.190
Ye-sung! Thank you!

01:11:13.857 --> 01:11:15.484
- Dont cry. - Stop crying!

01:11:15.484 --> 01:11:17.986
Is Young-hoon your boyfriend?

01:11:17.986 --> 01:11:18.946
- Yes. - Is he cool?

01:11:18.946 --> 01:11:20.531
Hes reassuring.

01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:24.910
Youre reassuring to me.

01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:27.996
- So reassuring! - Stop it!

01:11:28.622 --> 01:11:31.375
Youre the most reassuring.

01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:34.545
I was so fast, you couldnt see my fists!

01:11:39.049 --> 01:11:40.092
Good!

01:11:40.634 --> 01:11:41.593
Yong-gu!

01:11:41.927 --> 01:11:43.011
Hello.

01:11:43.095 --> 01:11:44.888
Your trial date is set.

01:11:46.348 --> 01:11:49.434
Last trial for a verdict hearing. Do good on your last chance.

01:11:49.434 --> 01:11:51.103
Do a good job.

01:11:55.399 --> 01:11:58.402
Its no time to be running!

01:11:59.653 --> 01:12:01.071
Yong-gu!

01:12:01.071 --> 01:12:02.155
Crazy fool!

01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:39.985
She just fell?

01:12:39.985 --> 01:12:42.571
And died just like that?

01:12:43.322 --> 01:12:44.323
Yes.

01:12:44.323 --> 01:12:46.617
Thats really weird.

01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:50.454
How was she lying on the ground?

01:12:52.748 --> 01:12:55.834
Just fallen down. It was scary.

01:12:57.419 --> 01:13:01.632
What if someone else killed her to steal

01:13:01.632 --> 01:13:02.883
the Sailor Moon bag?

01:13:02.883 --> 01:13:04.384
Cut the crap, fool!

01:13:07.721 --> 01:13:11.642
So, when you went there she was just lying?

01:13:11.642 --> 01:13:12.351
Yes.

01:13:12.351 --> 01:13:14.353
- For no reason? - Yes.

01:13:21.026 --> 01:13:22.402
Think it could kill you?

01:13:22.402 --> 01:13:25.697
My arm! It hurts!

01:13:25.697 --> 01:13:27.991
Right! Arms!

01:13:27.991 --> 01:13:31.453
People usually fall arm first.

01:13:31.453 --> 01:13:32.162
Right!

01:13:32.162 --> 01:13:35.082
But her back of the head cracked.

01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:37.918
Howd that happen?

01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:40.462
Let me think.

01:13:45.384 --> 01:13:48.470
The Sailor Moon bag!

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:49.471
Right!

01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:51.807
The Sailor Moon bag.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.938
She was skipping like this?

01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:06.071
Right! Its the bag!

01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:09.491
What was the date on that day?

01:14:10.409 --> 01:14:13.453
February 27th, 115 p.m. During lunch break.

01:14:13.453 --> 01:14:15.998
Okay! February 27th...

01:14:15.998 --> 01:14:20.669
That day was our bath day!

01:14:22.713 --> 01:14:24.047
What the!

01:14:24.047 --> 01:14:25.507
Theres no water.

01:14:25.507 --> 01:14:27.217
Turn the water on!

01:14:27.551 --> 01:14:30.220
The pipes froze over so we couldnt take showers!

01:14:32.139 --> 01:14:35.434
- Right! It was -18C! - Yeah!

01:14:36.518 --> 01:14:38.353
She slipped on ice!

01:14:41.398 --> 01:14:43.358
Thats it, boss!

01:14:43.358 --> 01:14:46.778
Theres water everywhere in the markets.

01:14:46.778 --> 01:14:48.780
Thats right!

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:51.658
Then, what about the wound on the kids forehead?

01:14:52.492 --> 01:14:55.871
There was a brick next to her?

01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:57.915
Yes. There was a brick.

01:14:57.915 --> 01:14:59.082
A brick?

01:15:01.084 --> 01:15:03.212
- Wait... - A brick?

01:15:03.212 --> 01:15:04.755
While she fell...

01:15:18.352 --> 01:15:21.480
Im dying here!

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.734
But whyd you pull her pants off?

01:15:27.402 --> 01:15:32.616
First, loosen the pants to help blood circulation.

01:15:32.616 --> 01:15:34.076
- Blood circulation? - Yes.

01:15:34.076 --> 01:15:35.869
Then, whyd you strangle her?

01:15:35.869 --> 01:15:37.371
I didnt.

01:15:38.455 --> 01:15:39.581
Second...

01:15:40.207 --> 01:15:42.584
Press the chest vertically.

01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:48.048
Next...

01:15:48.048 --> 01:15:51.343
Free the airway and block the nose.

01:15:51.343 --> 01:15:55.180
Breathe in 12 times a minute.

01:16:01.937 --> 01:16:04.314
- Good job. - Yes.

01:16:04.314 --> 01:16:06.233
Next?

01:16:06.233 --> 01:16:10.946
Wake up! Wake up! Are you okay?

01:16:10.946 --> 01:16:12.948
- Wake up! - Good.

01:16:12.948 --> 01:16:15.784
Shake the patient to gain consciousness.

01:16:15.784 --> 01:16:17.035
Next?

01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:21.206
Pinch or slap.

01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:25.919
- Dont hit for real, sir! - Hes alive.

01:16:25.919 --> 01:16:29.715
- Damn it! - Right. Hes alive.

01:16:29.715 --> 01:16:33.594
Now, lets follow along.

01:16:33.594 --> 01:16:36.013
Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation.

01:16:36.013 --> 01:16:40.100
- Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation. - Thats right.

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:43.353
- CPR. Right. - Of course!

01:16:43.353 --> 01:16:46.607
It was the Commissioner Generals kid.

01:16:46.607 --> 01:16:48.650
And its no fun drawing blame on the market.

01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:52.608
Pressure to solve the case all around them!

01:16:52.529 --> 01:16:55.532
Yong-gu got talked into taking the blame!

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.242
Shoot!

01:16:57.242 --> 01:16:58.702
Well do Yong-gus trial!

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:05.459
I object!

01:17:06.293 --> 01:17:09.296
The witnesses claim only circumstantial evidence.

01:17:09.296 --> 01:17:13.592
The witnesses testified to only what is true.

01:17:14.343 --> 01:17:16.011
Really?

01:17:20.766 --> 01:17:22.643
- Mr. So? - Yes?

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.479
What did you do in life?

01:17:28.857 --> 01:17:30.400
Hallelujah. Im a pastor.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.735
I mean your past.

01:17:31.735 --> 01:17:32.444
What?

01:17:33.862 --> 01:17:37.699
Im not sure when you are referring to.

01:17:37.699 --> 01:17:41.036
I also made clubs with friends to play soccer.

01:17:41.036 --> 01:17:42.287
Werent you a gangster?

01:17:43.872 --> 01:17:44.206
What?

01:17:44.206 --> 01:17:45.290
Your Honor!

01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:48.669
- His past is irrelevant to... - And you? Mr. Choi?

01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:55.133
Ive always been interested in sunken treasure ships.

01:17:55.133 --> 01:17:58.804
- Charged on 7 accounts of fraud? - I object!

01:17:59.555 --> 01:18:02.724
Bringing up the witnesses past is irrelevant to this case.

01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:04.351
Overruled.

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:12.651
Can we trust testimonies from men who served sentences?

01:18:12.651 --> 01:18:13.819
Look, Brother...

01:18:13.819 --> 01:18:16.238
I mean, Prosecutor?

01:18:16.238 --> 01:18:18.115
Is there a law...

01:18:18.115 --> 01:18:23.954
that states testimonies from former inmates cant be trusted?

01:18:24.872 --> 01:18:26.957
- No, but... - So, tell me!

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:33.547
Is there a law that says folks like us always lie!

01:18:38.093 --> 01:18:39.845
No, there isnt.

01:18:39.845 --> 01:18:44.016
- No further examination. - You mean questions!

01:18:44.016 --> 01:18:45.475
Were not suspects here!

01:18:49.021 --> 01:18:50.314
Order!

01:18:50.314 --> 01:18:51.398
I apologize.

01:18:52.733 --> 01:18:54.026
Defense?

01:18:54.026 --> 01:18:55.861
Do you have another witness?

01:18:55.861 --> 01:18:59.615
As the prosecution requests, he has no criminal record.

01:18:59.615 --> 01:19:03.076
Rather, he has worked hard for the country.

01:19:03.869 --> 01:19:06.038
I call the prison Chief at the time to the stand.

01:19:07.831 --> 01:19:09.458
- Lets go. - Sure.

01:19:26.308 --> 01:19:28.894
I am Jang Min-hwan Chief of Security at Prison.

01:19:30.145 --> 01:19:33.106
- One of our inmates... - How is he?

01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:40.405
Eating three meals a day.

01:19:43.408 --> 01:19:45.327
Exercising when its time.

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.163
When its past 900 p.m...

01:19:49.665 --> 01:19:51.416
hell probably sleep.

01:19:53.794 --> 01:19:54.962
Commissioner?

01:19:56.088 --> 01:20:00.175
I know its not my place, but please re-investigate the case.

01:20:01.885 --> 01:20:03.929
Then, hell walk free after his term.

01:20:07.349 --> 01:20:08.642
Am I wrong?

01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:13.564
Lee Yong-gu...

01:20:16.316 --> 01:20:17.568
Hes innocent, sir.

01:20:23.198 --> 01:20:24.408
A child...

01:20:26.493 --> 01:20:28.036
Ever lost one?

01:20:34.877 --> 01:20:36.253
Yes, I have.

01:20:40.299 --> 01:20:42.050
To an inmate I cherished.

01:20:50.475 --> 01:20:51.810
Defendant?

01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:57.232
Did you abduct the Commissioners daughter to get revenge?

01:20:59.818 --> 01:21:02.613
Yes. I followed her.

01:21:02.613 --> 01:21:04.860
Sailor Moon bag store.

01:21:05.199 --> 01:21:08.952
Daddy! Just read what the uncles wrote.

01:21:08.952 --> 01:21:10.370
Read it!

01:21:13.248 --> 01:21:19.630
Ji-young said shed show me a store that sells Sailor Moon bags.

01:21:19.630 --> 01:21:21.381
So, I just followed her.

01:21:21.381 --> 01:21:22.925
- Thats it. - Good!

01:21:22.925 --> 01:21:26.845
Did you pull her pants off to sexually abuse her?

01:21:26.845 --> 01:21:28.013
Did you?

01:21:28.805 --> 01:21:31.266
First, loosen pants for blood circulation.

01:21:31.266 --> 01:21:32.059
Good!

01:21:34.269 --> 01:21:37.314
Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation.

01:21:38.023 --> 01:21:41.068
I dont remember.

01:21:41.068 --> 01:21:43.904
Did you hit Choi Ji-young with a brick to kill her?

01:21:43.904 --> 01:21:46.990
No. Ji-young fell and...

01:21:49.201 --> 01:21:50.536
- Yong-gu! - Oh my!

01:21:50.994 --> 01:21:52.788
When you cant remember, what do you say?

01:21:54.665 --> 01:21:55.624
I...

01:21:59.127 --> 01:22:00.087
dont remember.

01:22:00.087 --> 01:22:01.380
Thats good.

01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:02.673
- I dont remember. - Good.

01:22:02.673 --> 01:22:03.674
Remember...

01:22:03.674 --> 01:22:06.009
- Happy! Happy! - Happy, Happy Happy Mart.

01:22:06.009 --> 01:22:07.094
Thats good!

01:22:07.094 --> 01:22:09.179
A brick fell on her head.

01:22:09.179 --> 01:22:10.264
- Did you see it? - No, I didnt.

01:22:10.264 --> 01:22:12.099
Come on, pal!

01:22:12.099 --> 01:22:15.018
- Just pretend you know! - Thats right!

01:22:15.185 --> 01:22:18.146
Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation...

01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:20.482
Yong-gu!

01:22:20.482 --> 01:22:21.608
Yes?

01:22:21.608 --> 01:22:23.902
Do it in the morning.

01:22:24.319 --> 01:22:25.320
Yes.

01:22:27.489 --> 01:22:31.034
Your Honor...

01:22:31.702 --> 01:22:38.292
I am intellectually impaired.

01:22:39.626 --> 01:22:42.504
The scary policemen hit me.

01:22:44.756 --> 01:22:46.091
They didnt investigate.

01:22:46.675 --> 01:22:48.385
- PETITION- Read this over.

01:22:48.385 --> 01:22:50.762
- What is it? - Here.

01:22:50.762 --> 01:22:52.556
I wrote it myself!

01:22:52.556 --> 01:22:54.057
Pass the pens!

01:22:54.057 --> 01:22:56.185
Dont spill on it. Write clearly.

01:22:56.185 --> 01:22:58.145
Sign it.

01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:03.817
They said if I signed, theyll send me home to Ye-sung.

01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:07.362
And buy me the Sailor Moon bag.

01:23:07.362 --> 01:23:08.488
And so...

01:23:10.032 --> 01:23:12.159
the written statement...

01:23:14.912 --> 01:23:17.206
is all fabricated.

01:23:17.206 --> 01:23:18.665
Perfect! You win!

01:23:18.665 --> 01:23:19.208
Daddy!

01:23:19.208 --> 01:23:20.709
Good job!

01:23:23.712 --> 01:23:26.590
- Yong-gu! - Yes?

01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:28.800
Your lawyer is here to see you.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.676
Yes?

01:23:29.676 --> 01:23:31.803
Is this a prison or daycare!

01:23:32.846 --> 01:23:36.850
Anything youd like to eat? I can get it for you.

01:23:38.101 --> 01:23:39.311
Free Time!

01:23:40.145 --> 01:23:41.480
The chocolate bar?

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.482
Yes, tasty Free Time.

01:23:44.066 --> 01:23:47.022
You have a daughter. Ye-sung?

01:23:47.361 --> 01:23:50.781
Yes. Ye-sung is pretty.

01:23:51.907 --> 01:23:54.618
- Listen to me carefully. - Yes.

01:23:55.202 --> 01:23:59.081
The girls father is the police commissioner.

01:23:59.081 --> 01:24:00.249
Yes.

01:24:01.041 --> 01:24:02.709
Damn...

01:24:04.294 --> 01:24:05.712
You know! The police!

01:24:06.922 --> 01:24:09.299
Yes, police. Very scary.

01:24:09.299 --> 01:24:11.593
Hes the leader of the scary men!

01:24:12.219 --> 01:24:14.763
Hes totally out of it!

01:24:14.763 --> 01:24:17.224
He could harm Ye-sung!

01:24:18.892 --> 01:24:20.060
Yes.

01:24:20.853 --> 01:24:23.564
How frustrating.

01:24:24.523 --> 01:24:25.774
Mr. Lawyer?

01:24:26.733 --> 01:24:27.860
Mr. Lawyer?

01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:33.782
Here are our inmates petitions.

01:24:35.659 --> 01:24:37.953
These things dont really help.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.418
Even a public lawyer should show dedication!

01:24:45.878 --> 01:24:47.838
It still wont lessen his sentence.

01:24:51.049 --> 01:24:52.176
Look!

01:24:52.634 --> 01:24:54.052
Look at this!

01:24:54.052 --> 01:24:57.431
Lee Yong-gu is not smart enough to write this!

01:24:58.056 --> 01:24:59.808
Still think hes the culprit!

01:25:20.204 --> 01:25:21.914
Think of Ye-sung...

01:25:22.915 --> 01:25:24.625
and stay focused.

01:25:26.293 --> 01:25:27.294
Yes.

01:25:28.253 --> 01:25:29.880
I must go home.

01:25:30.797 --> 01:25:31.840
Right.

01:25:33.634 --> 01:25:36.094
You can go home. Dont worry.

01:25:36.845 --> 01:25:38.263
Got that?

01:25:38.263 --> 01:25:39.181
Yes.

01:25:44.561 --> 01:25:52.402
Ji-young said she knew a store that sold the Sailor Moon bag.

01:25:55.113 --> 01:25:56.740
So, I followed her.

01:25:58.742 --> 01:26:02.496
But Ji-young suddenly fell.

01:26:12.047 --> 01:26:16.760
Speak clearly to the judge.

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.805
Speak clearly.

01:26:22.099 --> 01:26:27.688
He wanted revenge on the Commissioner for getting hit.

01:26:28.021 --> 01:26:31.900
So, you abducted his daughter Ji-young, correct?

01:26:36.947 --> 01:26:38.156
I repeat.

01:26:38.574 --> 01:26:41.410
Did you abduct Choi Ji-young?

01:26:41.410 --> 01:26:46.123
You must die for Ye-sung to live. You get it?

01:26:46.456 --> 01:26:48.166
Youre the father.

01:26:50.335 --> 01:26:55.757
When Ji-young resisted sexual assault...

01:26:55.757 --> 01:26:58.385
you killed her with a brick, correct?

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.768
I repeat the question.

01:27:07.311 --> 01:27:10.522
Did you strike Choi Ji-young with a brick?

01:27:13.192 --> 01:27:14.151
Defendant!

01:27:15.485 --> 01:27:17.029
Answer the question.

01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:23.911
Accept your punishment.

01:27:26.163 --> 01:27:31.210
If not, Ill do the same to your daughter.

01:27:48.519 --> 01:27:50.187
Answer the question.

01:27:51.563 --> 01:27:52.606
Yes.

01:27:57.444 --> 01:28:04.243
When Ji-young resisted sexual assault...

01:28:04.243 --> 01:28:07.412
you killed her with a brick, correct?

01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:15.504
I repeat the question.

01:28:16.046 --> 01:28:19.633
Did you strike Choi Ji-young with a brick?

01:28:27.808 --> 01:28:30.394
Did you kill her with a brick?

01:28:34.356 --> 01:28:35.899
- Defendant! - Yes.

01:28:35.899 --> 01:28:38.402
Did you kill her with a brick?

01:28:38.402 --> 01:28:40.279
Yes, I did.

01:28:43.156 --> 01:28:46.702
Bastard! Think your kid will be fine!

01:28:46.702 --> 01:28:49.872
Ill kill your kid, too!

01:28:54.334 --> 01:28:55.627
Ji-young!

01:28:58.046 --> 01:28:59.798
Ill kill your kid, too!

01:29:08.432 --> 01:29:12.144
Yes. I did it. I did it.

01:29:14.062 --> 01:29:16.982
Lee Yong-gu! What are you saying!

01:29:17.524 --> 01:29:19.067
Come to your senses!

01:29:19.735 --> 01:29:23.447
Your Honor, the defendant is psychologically intimidated.

01:29:23.447 --> 01:29:24.573
Order!

01:29:24.948 --> 01:29:27.618
Youre his lawyer! Do something!

01:29:29.745 --> 01:29:30.704
I killed her. I did.

01:29:30.704 --> 01:29:32.539
Are you out of your mind!

01:29:32.539 --> 01:29:34.958
You didnt kill anyone!

01:29:34.958 --> 01:29:37.669
She died because of me.

01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:39.588
Im sorry. Very sorry.

01:29:39.588 --> 01:29:44.051
Whyre you sorry! No one apologized to you!

01:29:44.051 --> 01:29:45.969
Why are you so sorry!

01:29:45.969 --> 01:29:48.472
If you speak out, youll be ordered to leave.

01:29:48.472 --> 01:29:53.852
Please help my Ye-sung. My daughter.

01:29:53.852 --> 01:29:56.480
- Order! - I did it.

01:30:20.712 --> 01:30:22.422
What are you doing!

01:30:24.633 --> 01:30:25.926
Youre a lawyer!

01:30:27.386 --> 01:30:29.680
A lawyer cant be like this!

01:30:35.769 --> 01:30:39.356
The police only took the witness accounts...

01:30:39.356 --> 01:30:42.943
and dismissed the defendants denials.

01:30:43.652 --> 01:30:49.825
Lees statement was fabricated by force from the police.

01:30:49.825 --> 01:30:50.868
Also!

01:30:50.868 --> 01:30:53.287
Ji-young did not die of the brick wound...

01:30:53.287 --> 01:30:57.457
but an occipital injury! That too was dismissed!

01:30:58.292 --> 01:31:04.381
Contrary to police claims that Lee strangled her...

01:31:04.381 --> 01:31:10.470
her autopsy showed no sign of strangling whatsoever!

01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:12.764
Defense? Give your final argument.

01:31:14.057 --> 01:31:15.517
Your Honor.

01:31:16.226 --> 01:31:19.855
I request for leniency.

01:31:21.523 --> 01:31:23.775
The prosecutions demand?

01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:29.740
The defendant admitted to the charges.

01:31:30.115 --> 01:31:37.247
I request the same sentence to the defendant as the first trial.

01:31:41.752 --> 01:31:43.003
Your Honor!

01:31:43.504 --> 01:31:45.923
The investigation is biased.

01:31:45.923 --> 01:31:52.095
It was only forcibly done to establish a crime.

01:31:52.095 --> 01:31:54.890
They dismissed the principle of presumed innocence!

01:31:55.849 --> 01:31:58.393
They abused the defendants mental disability...

01:31:58.393 --> 01:32:00.896
and love for his daughter

01:32:01.605 --> 01:32:04.358
to force him to give up on everything!

01:32:05.692 --> 01:32:09.571
The innocent defendant was sacrificed at their convenience!

01:32:09.571 --> 01:32:15.827
As the defendant admitted to the charges, the trial is adjourned.

01:32:16.662 --> 01:32:22.209
The defendants appeal is rejected.

01:32:22.209 --> 01:32:25.420
The first trials sentence stands.

01:32:26.296 --> 01:32:31.093
Defendant Lee Yong-gu is sentenced to death.

01:32:38.684 --> 01:32:39.726
Thank you.

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:43.230
Thank you.

01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:46.316
Thank you.

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.737
I was wrong.

01:32:56.243 --> 01:32:58.704
Please help Ye-sung.

01:33:02.165 --> 01:33:03.584
Its my fault.

01:33:07.921 --> 01:33:09.882
And so, I defend...

01:33:14.136 --> 01:33:17.181
a man wrongfully sentenced to death...

01:33:19.183 --> 01:33:24.771
to clear defendant Lee Yong-gus false accusations.

01:33:26.773 --> 01:33:28.066
That is why...

01:33:30.485 --> 01:33:32.196
I am here today.

01:33:35.199 --> 01:33:38.410
His wife said, I can take piano lessons.

01:33:39.203 --> 01:33:41.747
Piano?

01:33:42.497 --> 01:33:45.125
The Chief has a piano at home.

01:33:45.125 --> 01:33:48.587
Daddy, Ill play it for you later.

01:33:48.587 --> 01:33:51.507
Piano? I like piano.

01:33:52.549 --> 01:33:56.845
Daddy? Youre not a bad man, right?

01:34:02.267 --> 01:34:03.602
- Yong-gu? - Yes.

01:34:06.605 --> 01:34:07.648
Take care.

01:34:10.734 --> 01:34:14.738
One, two, three!

01:34:28.961 --> 01:34:32.256
See? Isnt cooking fun?

01:34:32.256 --> 01:34:35.670
Itd be easier to eat out.

01:34:35.634 --> 01:34:39.179
Ye-sung makes this a special Thanksgiving.

01:34:39.513 --> 01:34:42.599
Ye-sung made this pretty one.

01:34:45.143 --> 01:34:46.353
You too, Mister.

01:34:48.564 --> 01:34:52.317
Its from Ye-sung!

01:34:54.903 --> 01:34:57.406
Hi, Daddy.

01:34:58.282 --> 01:35:00.659
How are you?

01:35:00.659 --> 01:35:03.787
- Is it from Ye-sung? - Letter from Ye-sung!

01:35:03.787 --> 01:35:05.956
Let me see!

01:35:07.082 --> 01:35:08.417
Tada!

01:35:09.251 --> 01:35:11.920
100! Ye-sung got perfect!

01:35:14.214 --> 01:35:15.340
Good job!

01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:18.177
Bong-sun should be a model when she grows up.

01:35:18.927 --> 01:35:19.970
Funny.

01:35:21.054 --> 01:35:22.723
Baby looks funny.

01:35:24.016 --> 01:35:27.686
- Hes way too honest. - Im sorry.

01:35:30.647 --> 01:35:37.112
Fall on your knees

01:35:37.112 --> 01:35:44.995
Hear the angel voices

01:35:44.995 --> 01:35:50.417
Night divine

01:35:50.918 --> 01:35:55.380
Hello...

01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:59.510
Uncle...

01:36:01.178 --> 01:36:03.138
Uncle 1004, hello! Are you studying hard?

01:36:03.138 --> 01:36:06.767
Im dying to hear you read to me soon.

01:36:06.767 --> 01:36:08.810
I hope you get along well with Daddy and the others.

01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:10.145
Take care. From Ye-sung!

01:36:10.145 --> 01:36:11.766
Its been hours!

01:36:17.903 --> 01:36:19.696
Hello...

01:36:20.239 --> 01:36:25.494
Shouldnt we prepare something for the annual talent show?

01:36:26.119 --> 01:36:28.205
Thats a bunch of lies.

01:36:28.205 --> 01:36:30.207
If we place first, will they let us out?

01:36:31.083 --> 01:36:34.586
Yeah! One night out with family.

01:36:34.586 --> 01:36:35.587
Really?

01:36:35.587 --> 01:36:37.005
- Disgusting! - Ye-sung!

01:36:37.005 --> 01:36:39.091
How about singing?

01:36:39.091 --> 01:36:41.134
Yes, singing! Sailor Moon!

01:36:41.134 --> 01:36:41.969
Good idea!

01:36:41.969 --> 01:36:45.889
- She will never turn her back - Cut that out!

01:36:49.852 --> 01:36:50.894
Sir?

01:36:50.894 --> 01:36:54.439
There are more Christmas amnesties this year.

01:36:56.441 --> 01:36:58.527
Due to presidential elections?

01:36:59.236 --> 01:37:01.613
Right, the elections.

01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:05.367
Lots to send off, too.

01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:11.665
Pardon?

01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:15.043
The dates been set for 5482.

01:37:15.586 --> 01:37:17.296
December 23rd.

01:37:23.218 --> 01:37:24.803
- Spider. - Louder.

01:37:25.095 --> 01:37:26.972
- Spider. - Louder.

01:37:27.264 --> 01:37:28.473
Spider!

01:37:28.724 --> 01:37:30.809
- What about this? - This?

01:37:32.436 --> 01:37:33.729
Philippines.

01:37:33.729 --> 01:37:35.564
Morphine?

01:37:35.564 --> 01:37:38.025
No, it says Hairpin!

01:37:41.612 --> 01:37:43.864
You read that already!

01:37:47.034 --> 01:37:48.744
So weak in the head!

01:37:50.537 --> 01:37:51.830
Stop it!

01:37:54.917 --> 01:37:58.795
Ye-sung

01:38:00.881 --> 01:38:04.092
I cant decide that on my own.

01:38:05.385 --> 01:38:09.181
Ill need permission from the principal.

01:38:09.181 --> 01:38:10.933
This is the last time.

01:38:12.184 --> 01:38:13.227
Pardon?

01:38:17.105 --> 01:38:19.483
That Ye-sung can see her father.

01:38:21.735 --> 01:38:23.570
Please help.

01:38:25.948 --> 01:38:27.407
Im begging you.

01:38:32.037 --> 01:38:33.539
Pretty.

01:38:33.539 --> 01:38:35.791
Damn it!

01:38:35.958 --> 01:38:39.378
Whys the execution so soon after the trial?

01:38:40.003 --> 01:38:42.464
This should be protested.

01:38:42.464 --> 01:38:47.219
It goes completely against existing laws!

01:38:47.219 --> 01:38:50.597
I should be the one to go first.

01:38:51.223 --> 01:38:54.726
Everyone in the prison deserves to go before him.

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:03.443
Yong-gu... We cant let him go like this.

01:39:05.028 --> 01:39:05.940
Hey, Chun-ho!

01:39:05.904 --> 01:39:06.947
Yes?

01:39:20.377 --> 01:39:21.712
Oh no!

01:39:21.712 --> 01:39:23.422
Whats going on!

01:39:23.422 --> 01:39:25.716
Im sorry. Whyd this break?

01:39:26.175 --> 01:39:27.301
Take them quick!

01:39:30.012 --> 01:39:30.929
Ouch!

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:34.474
Its saving a mans life.

01:39:34.808 --> 01:39:37.561
Only if you give me your turf.

01:39:41.982 --> 01:39:43.775
One!

01:39:44.943 --> 01:39:46.570
The hell!

01:39:47.529 --> 01:39:48.071
Two!

01:40:01.627 --> 01:40:02.711
Gotcha!

01:40:06.632 --> 01:40:08.342
Youre working?

01:40:09.468 --> 01:40:11.303
Carry on, then.

01:40:14.097 --> 01:40:15.516
You heard?

01:40:15.516 --> 01:40:19.728
If you think this is your father, please come up.

01:40:19.728 --> 01:40:23.273
Do it right. Its to save a life. Got it?

01:40:23.273 --> 01:40:24.066
Yes, boss!

01:40:27.361 --> 01:40:29.154
Where are the boys?

01:40:29.154 --> 01:40:31.740
Its taking long to blow up the big thing.

01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:34.785
You sure hes your father?

01:40:38.747 --> 01:40:40.123
You said, youre an orphan.

01:40:44.753 --> 01:40:48.257
All the fathers in the world is my father!

01:40:51.009 --> 01:40:53.136
Go Cell 7! Go!

01:41:18.245 --> 01:41:21.582
O holy night

01:41:21.582 --> 01:41:26.044
The stars are brightly shining

01:41:26.044 --> 01:41:33.093
It is the night of the dear Saviors birth

01:41:36.388 --> 01:41:39.641
Long lay the world

01:41:39.641 --> 01:41:44.104
In sin and error pining

01:41:44.104 --> 01:41:51.153
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth

01:41:52.446 --> 01:41:59.661
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices

01:41:59.661 --> 01:42:07.044
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

01:42:07.044 --> 01:42:13.300
Fall on your knees

01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:21.266
Hear the angel voice

01:42:21.266 --> 01:42:27.606
Night divine

01:42:28.607 --> 01:42:35.322
Night when Christ was born

01:42:35.322 --> 01:42:41.954
Night divine

01:42:42.704 --> 01:42:44.623
Night divine

01:42:44.623 --> 01:42:45.874
Everythings all set?

01:42:45.874 --> 01:42:50.087
Dont worry. Ye-sungs teachers on our side.

01:42:53.215 --> 01:43:01.098
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus praise we

01:43:01.098 --> 01:43:07.896
Let all within us praise His holy name

01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:13.277
Daddy? Hand.

01:43:14.695 --> 01:43:15.904
Hold hands.

01:43:17.155 --> 01:43:20.492
- Hurry up! - Hold hands!

01:43:22.202 --> 01:43:23.287
Hold!

01:44:16.924 --> 01:44:18.300
Lets go!

01:44:18.759 --> 01:44:19.635
Lets go!

01:44:24.181 --> 01:44:26.266
Chun-ho! Get him out!

01:44:26.266 --> 01:44:28.101
Yong-gu! Hurry!

01:44:37.653 --> 01:44:41.156
Get them off!

01:44:41.156 --> 01:44:42.533
Get em out!

01:44:43.992 --> 01:44:45.160
Get them in!

01:44:53.168 --> 01:44:54.044
Untie it!

01:45:12.271 --> 01:45:14.398
Daddy! Were flying!

01:45:14.398 --> 01:45:15.983
Were flying!

01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:23.490
Daddy, people are so tiny.

01:45:25.993 --> 01:45:27.953
- They cant leave! - Chief...

01:45:27.953 --> 01:45:29.621
Were flying like birds!

01:45:29.621 --> 01:45:30.831
Were flying!

01:45:31.707 --> 01:45:33.166
Goodbye uncles!

01:45:33.166 --> 01:45:34.126
Get them!

01:45:34.126 --> 01:45:35.294
Stop em!

01:45:37.754 --> 01:45:39.256
Stop em!

01:46:07.117 --> 01:46:08.869
Look over there!

01:46:10.454 --> 01:46:12.623
People are dancing!

01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:18.587
Get them!

01:46:24.259 --> 01:46:26.011
What are you doing up there?

01:46:26.011 --> 01:46:28.180
Hello, Mister!

01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:30.516
Ah, hello!

01:46:30.766 --> 01:46:32.726
The sunset is pretty!

01:46:32.726 --> 01:46:34.770
Yes, it is.

01:46:35.187 --> 01:46:37.564
Goodbye!

01:46:40.901 --> 01:46:42.861
Daddy! Look over there!

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:45.197
Over there!

01:46:45.197 --> 01:46:48.659
- Daddy? Are we going home? - Were going home!

01:46:48.659 --> 01:46:50.118
Im so happy!

01:47:12.057 --> 01:47:13.350
Stop them!

01:48:08.739 --> 01:48:09.865
Ye-sung...

01:48:10.824 --> 01:48:12.034
Yes, Daddy?

01:48:14.453 --> 01:48:15.621
Dont forget.

01:48:17.831 --> 01:48:19.124
What, Daddy?

01:48:20.417 --> 01:48:21.460
Today...

01:48:24.588 --> 01:48:26.215
And...Daddy.

01:48:52.533 --> 01:48:54.201
Eat lots! Is it good?

01:48:54.201 --> 01:48:56.411
- Yes, its yummy. - Its yummy.

01:48:57.579 --> 01:49:00.040
Eat beans! Vitamins!

01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:02.167
- Get ready. - Yes, boss.

01:49:05.712 --> 01:49:08.048
Tada!

01:49:08.048 --> 01:49:09.341
A cake!

01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:11.260
Blow out the candles.

01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:13.095
One, two, three!

01:49:15.264 --> 01:49:16.431
All blown out!

01:58:56.887 --> 01:58:57.971
No...

01:59:00.349 --> 01:59:03.268
My dad whom I loved most in the world.

01:59:04.811 --> 01:59:06.897
For my angelic father.

01:59:12.861 --> 01:59:16.949
The defense gives the final argument.

01:59:21.745 --> 01:59:23.288
In the name of justice...

01:59:27.084 --> 01:59:28.168
I will...

01:59:30.796 --> 01:59:31.922

01:59:34.132 --> 01:59:35.509
my father.

02:00:05.581 --> 02:00:10.919
Defendant Lee Yong-gus disability is recognized.

02:00:10.919 --> 02:00:14.756
He was threatened and beaten by the police.

02:00:15.674 --> 02:00:19.386
The court accepts he was forced to confess.

02:00:20.888 --> 02:00:23.348
According to testimonies...

02:00:24.266 --> 02:00:27.269
there is not enough evidence...

02:00:27.269 --> 02:00:32.858
that he abducted, sexually abused, then killed Choi Ji-young.

02:00:42.576 --> 02:00:45.746
The court remands this case...

02:00:46.371 --> 02:00:49.625
and overturn Lees death sentence...

02:00:50.292 --> 02:00:53.212
and demands a re-investigation.

02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:55.380
The court finds Lee Yong-gu...

02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:57.549
not guilty!

02:02:03.323 --> 02:02:05.576
- Ye-sung! - Hello!

02:02:05.576 --> 02:02:09.746
