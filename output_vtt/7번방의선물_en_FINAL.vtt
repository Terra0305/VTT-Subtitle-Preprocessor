00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:03.730
It was hard to get, being such a sensitive case.


00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.254
Going to meet him, tomorrow?


00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:30.507
Yes.


00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.886
Say ‘hi' for me. Tell him to come by.


00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:37.848
But he probably won't want to come back.


00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:41.768
Thank you, Daddy.


00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.563
Goo-goo-ga-ga!


00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:10.691
Stars and Moon.


00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.069
The baby god is here.


00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.697
What do you see?


00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.828
Your eyes are set wide apart. You have siblings luck.


00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.206
I'm an only child.


00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.088
That's why you're greedy.


00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:37.968
You're born with their luck, so you're lonely.


00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:39.595
I'm not lonely.


00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:56.528
The man you're dating will be your ruin. Break up! Dump him at once, sister! I don't have a boyfriend.


00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.534
I told you I can't work mornings! Bad brother!


00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.124
Spit it out! It's dirty! Drink this!


00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.252
Dad! Money!


00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.671
Why you!


00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:18.342
I told you not to barge in when we're working!


00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:21.887
You're Bong-sun!


00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:25.474
What the hell?


00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:30.562
- Do you know her? - Yes! Of course! Shin Bong-sun.


00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:36.276
Who are you!


00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.612
Scripture says...


00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:42.157
‘After desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin'.


00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:48.455
‘Sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death'. Amen!


00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:57.631
Righteous Heavenly Father...


00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.514
Why did you come?


00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:19.194
Ye-sung? Yesus? Jesus?


00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.037
It feels weird to be sitting rather than standing before the judge.


00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:30.455
You, too?


00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:38.297
I didn't do anything. Why am I nervous? Forget your dark pasts, brothers. - Amen. - Hallelujah.


00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:48.974
Chief!


00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:54.605
I mean, Warden. You all haven't changed.


00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:05.866
The Judicial Research and Training Institute's...


00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:10.037
mock trial will now begin.


00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.789
The prosecution may proceed.


00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:23.258
Defendant Lee Yong-gu abducted young Choi Ji-young... sexually abused her, and killed her with a brick.


00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:31.016
Everything has been proven by proper officials. I believe this case is not fit for a retrial whatsoever.


00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.144
Thank you.


00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.105
The defense may proceed.


00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.572
The prosecution's claim of proven evidence...


00:06:46.532 --> 00:06:55.582
that is the biggest error to this case. Your Honor, the defense speaks in contempt... Error? Yes, Your Honor.


00:06:56.124 --> 00:07:01.046
The prosecution is not the one who was assigned to this case.


00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:07.052
Contrary to other cases... the evidence and records must all be re-investigated.


00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:11.056
But the prosecution seeks a ruling


00:07:11.557 --> 00:07:14.309
by taking fabricated records and false testimonies only.


00:07:17.855 --> 00:07:22.651
Then, were you the one in charge of defense back then?


00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:26.196
Were you?


00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.534
No, I was not.


00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.079
No further questions.


00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:35.581
But!


00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.334
I was there.


00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.839
That is a clear fact.


00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:48.719
You were there?


00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:50.262
Yes.


00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:53.974
I was there.


00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:56.935
Your Honor.


00:07:57.603 --> 00:08:03.233
Everything I'm about to say is nothing but the truth.


00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:16.371
Fighting evil by moonlight Winning love by daylight Never running from a real fight FEBRUARY, 1997 She is the one name Sailor Moon


00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:21.502
In the name of justice, I will punish you!


00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:24.922
There's only one left.


00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:37.601
Ye-sung? We can buy it, tomorrow! It's payday? Yes! $638.80. We're rich! Yes! We're rich!


00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:42.731
- Daddy! The bag! - That's Ye-sung's...


00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.650
It's Ye-sung's!


00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:51.156
- This is Ye-sung's! - What? - Sailor Moon bag! - What's with him?


00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:53.033
Who are you?


00:08:54.159 --> 00:09:03.293
We came for this every day. Sometimes we came twice! Yes. Sometimes twice. Twice.


00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:11.260
- So pretty! It's Ye-sung's! - Don't touch her! This is Ye-sung's! - Who are you! - This is Ye-sung's!


00:09:11.969 --> 00:09:19.893
Don't hit my daddy! - Are you crazy? - This is Ye-sung's! How dare you! - Sir! Please, sir. - I'll report you to the police!


00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:27.401
She is the one named Sailor Moon


00:09:30.863 --> 00:09:34.575
Daddy? Why don't other stores sell it around here?


00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.539
Daddy will buy it. Sailor Moon bag.


00:09:41.123 --> 00:09:43.292
For your first day of school.


00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:44.960
It's okay.


00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.296
It's okay.


00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.507
Don't strain yourself.


00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.846
Don't strain yourself. Don't copy me.


00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.973
Don't copy me.


00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:02.561
Okay! Stop tickling! Stop!


00:10:13.322 --> 00:10:20.370
- Daddy? - Huh? Don't drink tap water. No tap water. Boiled water.


00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:25.709
Don't eat snacks for lunch. Have proper food. Okay?


00:10:26.877 --> 00:10:32.299
Have proper food, too. Okay? Okay. Ye-sung's cold.


00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.302
Ye-sung go inside.


00:10:38.514 --> 00:10:39.640
One...


00:10:40.516 --> 00:10:42.642
Two... Three!


00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.236
See you, Daddy!


00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.376
This way.


00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:09.044
Please wait.


00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:12.965
One,


00:11:13.507 --> 00:11:15.968
two, three...


00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:25.352
Mister? - Did you buy the bag? - Hi!


00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:27.896
The bag.


00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:29.773
Sailor Moon!


00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:35.779
Another store sells this. Sailor Moon! I must buy it! I'll buy.


00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.157
Mister! Come on!


00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:41.159
Wait for me.


00:11:41.994 --> 00:11:43.287
It's over there!


00:11:43.996 --> 00:11:45.122
Pretty.


00:11:46.582 --> 00:11:47.541
Sailor Moon!


00:11:50.002 --> 00:11:51.962
Stop playing.


00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:54.131
Sailor Moon bag! Pretty.


00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.641
It's cold...


00:12:11.857 --> 00:12:13.025
Oh my!


00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.327
Help! Help! Don't go!


00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:25.913
Help!


00:12:47.518 --> 00:12:57.903
Captain! It's packed here! Come quick, sir! The Commissioner General is coming, too! Hurry over!


00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:07.913
I must go home. Goodbye. Sit down. Get with the picture! - Ye-sung is waiting alone. - Okay. No comment.


00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:12.876
- Ye-sung is scared. - I know. Sit down! Stupid son of a bitch!


00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:17.422
Don't hit the guy! Why hit him!


00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:23.762
- Sit down! - Goodbye. I must go home. Get him!


00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:25.973
Film it!


00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.396
Stay still!


00:13:58.589 --> 00:13:59.923
This murder is...


00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:07.764
retaliation against the Police Commissioner. It is an attack... Here, sir!


00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.393
on the authority of the national police!


00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:16.690
The culprit is about to arrive for a re-enactment here.


00:14:17.608 --> 00:14:18.858
A big crowd...


00:14:19.568 --> 00:14:21.278
The culprit has just arrived!


00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:24.698
It's packed here. Let's go! He's getting out of the van!


00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.576
Let me interview him!


00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.252
You bastard!


00:14:42.508 --> 00:14:48.222
Lee is here to re-enact the crime. The murder is being re-enacted!


00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:52.100
- Do it in one go. - Sit down.


00:14:55.938 --> 00:15:00.442
- You strangled her! - Pushed her down? Slapped her cheeks! Kissed her!


00:15:05.364 --> 00:15:06.490
What next?


00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:24.924
Stripped her? Like this for blood circulation. I see. Take your pants off, too! - Not the pants! - Do it! That's embarrassing. Finish quick and go see your daughter. - Ye-sung. - Right. Ye-sung!


00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:28.095
Finish up to go see Ye-sung!


00:15:28.095 --> 00:15:30.305
That's good.


00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:34.226
You bastard!


00:15:38.647 --> 00:15:39.731
Who are you!


00:15:41.567 --> 00:15:42.568
Daddy!


00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.528
Daddy!


00:15:46.864 --> 00:15:47.906
Daddy!


00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:53.078
Ye-sung! Daddy! Ye-sung!


00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:56.415
Ye-sung!


00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.134
- Ye-sung! - Daddy!


00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:12.514
- Daddy! - Ye-sung! Daddy!


00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:24.984
Stay at home! See you soon! Daddy, don't go! I'll be home soon! - Daddy! - Ye-sung! Ye-sung!


00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:30.032
You'll catch a cold! - Daddy, no. - Ye-sung!


00:16:30.574 --> 00:16:32.659
Ye-sung! Daddy!


00:16:35.204 --> 00:16:36.371
Go!


00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.124
You'll catch a cold!


00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:49.176
Daddy! Daddy! - Go home! - Sit down! - You'll catch a cold! - Stay down!


00:16:56.934 --> 00:16:57.976
Come in.


00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:10.072
Go home on your day off, sir. What's all this?


00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.075
What good is home?


00:17:13.617 --> 00:17:19.540
What is it? New inmates have arrived. 4 new today, Chief.


00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:25.420
One of the inmates is an S4. - An S4? - Yes, sir.


00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:30.133
5482?


00:17:30.926 --> 00:17:35.931
A child kidnapper and rape killer.


00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:44.273
Hello.


00:17:52.823 --> 00:17:54.533
Everyone who comes here...


00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:58.328
all have hard lives.


00:17:59.663 --> 00:18:02.708
But still, you've committed crimes and...


00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:17.973
- I must call home. - No way! - Ye-sung is waiting alone. - No! 031-745-8700. - 5482! - 031-745-8700! - You can't! - Ye-sung is waiting alone!


00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:31.320
Thank you.


00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:34.865
Chief! Please!


00:18:43.165 --> 00:18:45.918
Hey! Get out! Crazy fool!


00:18:47.586 --> 00:18:52.633
I just came to wash up. For what! You freak!


00:18:52.925 --> 00:19:01.934
You fondled me last night! It was you! Not last night, bro! - It ain't me last night! - I felt it!


00:19:05.479 --> 00:19:08.440
Pathetic fools.


00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:10.150
Go on in.


00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:18.200
Go!


00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:25.415
Don't try to pull anything.


00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:29.336
BONG-SHIK Greet each other nicely.


00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:35.217
What do you mean, sir? Ever seen us harm anyone?


00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:42.349
- Try to get along. - Yes, sir. I'm off. CHUN-HO


00:19:48.564 --> 00:19:50.858
MAN-BEOM


00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:10.586
Bong-shik. Make him sing. Yes!


00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.630
Say, ‘hello'.


00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:15.716
Yes!


00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:19.511
Hello.


00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:22.472

By C-section. Mom hurt cuz my head was big!


00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:44.244
I caught fish in streams.


00:20:46.413 --> 00:21:00.802
When I was five, Mom died. Bus number 375. Accident. - At the funeral... - Enough! Dad wasn't there. - Only my uncles... - What's with him? and aunties...


00:21:01.303 --> 00:21:03.388
Hey! Yes?


00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:04.932
What did you do?


00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:13.690
I parked. At Happy, Happy Mart. Parking...parking cars.


00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:20.739
Must be illegal cars.


00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:28.664
Your spot is over there. Take your shoes off and go.


00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:33.460
Over there! Go!


00:21:34.086 --> 00:21:35.337
Listen!


00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:38.465
Let's see his records.

You fool! Keep reading! Criminal Code 305. Fornication with a minor! Son of a bitch! Cover him! Get him!

Criminal Code 298.


00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.470
Sexual molestation!


00:22:26.889 --> 00:22:30.893
Criminal Code 301. Rape and murder!


00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:34.980
Nasty bastard!


00:22:36.106 --> 00:22:37.356
Verdict!


00:22:37.816 --> 00:22:38.901
Execution?


00:22:44.907 --> 00:22:47.951
That kills the mood in our cell!


00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.870
The hell!


00:23:00.214 --> 00:23:01.548
Pay attention!


00:23:02.716 --> 00:23:08.222
Ye-sung came to stay with us. Say hi. Hi, Ye-sung.


00:23:11.183 --> 00:23:12.935
You say hi, too.


00:23:22.236 --> 00:23:27.115
DADDY, I'M AT AN ORPHANAGE 031-643-1573


00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:37.876
Ye-sung


00:23:49.179 --> 00:23:51.181
- Feeling better? - Yes, sir.


00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.594
Attention!


00:24:28.594 --> 00:24:29.845
Shall we?


00:24:30.345 --> 00:24:35.100
Pass! Pass! Let's play basketball.


00:24:42.608 --> 00:24:43.567
What the!


00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:46.403
- The ball went over. - Oh no!


00:24:46.778 --> 00:24:52.451
Would anyone out there be kind and throw it over?


00:24:58.665 --> 00:25:00.083
Thank you!


00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:04.046
- Vaseline? - Vaseline!


00:25:07.299 --> 00:25:08.800
You pervert!


00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.178
- It's used! Pay double! - Yes, sir!


00:25:11.887 --> 00:25:14.598
- Glue? - Whose is this? - Me, sir. - Come here.


00:25:14.598 --> 00:25:15.682
No glue for you!


00:25:17.392 --> 00:25:18.352
Ointment.


00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:31.865
Damn bastards messing with my turf.


00:25:36.245 --> 00:25:41.333
Now, we're getting paid! Wire the money right!


00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:44.878
- One-eyed. - Yes, boss.


00:25:47.214 --> 00:25:49.591
- Reserve solitary. - Yes, boss.


00:26:12.573 --> 00:26:13.866
Watch out!


00:26:16.702 --> 00:26:18.287
Boss!


00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:28.839
You out of your mind? Stop sucking like a kid.


00:26:30.174 --> 00:26:31.300
Son of a bitch.


00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.518
If you need something, ask me.


00:26:45.856 --> 00:26:53.780
1004? What are you doing? Bro! Break up! Move it!


00:26:53.906 --> 00:26:57.034
Don't sit. Lie down here.


00:26:57.034 --> 00:27:00.162
I should pay you back for saving my life.


00:27:00.704 --> 00:27:02.039
Anything you need?


00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:07.878
Go on. Tell me. You smoke?


00:27:08.754 --> 00:27:10.881
Smoking is bad. Dang.


00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:16.011
You don't know our boss.


00:27:16.345 --> 00:27:20.599
If you don't keep your word, you're just a thug!


00:27:22.518 --> 00:27:28.690
But a real gangster sticks to his word, like our boss. You get my meaning?


00:27:29.942 --> 00:27:34.530
You're in luck, pal. What do you need?


00:27:36.406 --> 00:27:37.366
Ye-sung.


00:27:38.408 --> 00:27:43.914
What? Huh? Who?


00:28:18.866 --> 00:28:20.701
Were there kids in the choir before?


00:28:23.412 --> 00:28:27.124
They picked 3 kids. Aren't they cute?


00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:34.673
Chief! Chief!


00:28:35.424 --> 00:28:41.763
The warden is looking for you. Hurry, sir! Why are they so loud!


00:28:57.988 --> 00:28:59.531
Ye-sung. Hold on.


00:29:13.962 --> 00:29:16.215
Came the wrong way.


00:29:26.225 --> 00:29:27.893
- Are you okay? - Yes, sir.


00:29:29.603 --> 00:29:30.395
No!


00:29:31.772 --> 00:29:32.814
Please!


00:29:33.398 --> 00:29:34.733
I'm fine!


00:29:34.942 --> 00:29:36.401
Just go, sir!


00:30:18.443 --> 00:30:20.237
Are you Yesus?


00:30:24.283 --> 00:30:25.367
Daddy!


00:30:35.544 --> 00:30:38.630
Where were you!


00:30:39.298 --> 00:30:43.093
What happened! I'm so sorry!


00:30:43.093 --> 00:30:57.274
Know how much I looked for you! - I'm sorry. - Where were you! - I'm sorry. - You disappeared. I'm sorry. Ye-sung is skinny. Why so light? Quiet.


00:30:57.274 --> 00:31:02.613
- Thank you! - Okay. Quiet. - This is wrong, boss! - Thank you.


00:31:02.946 --> 00:31:13.749
Think! What if we get caught? This can increase our sentences! - No way! - I'm out of this!


00:31:13.749 --> 00:31:15.584
Guard! Over here!


00:31:17.044 --> 00:31:21.715
Mister! I'm good at hiding! - Sir! - She can hide good!


00:31:23.425 --> 00:31:24.927
Sir! Over here!


00:31:30.182 --> 00:31:32.434
Bong-shik!


00:31:39.399 --> 00:31:40.484
Sir!


00:31:40.817 --> 00:31:42.402
What is it?


00:31:42.903 --> 00:31:46.782
Look! Look, what?


00:31:47.491 --> 00:31:48.659
In our cell!


00:31:55.624 --> 00:31:56.959
What?


00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:59.753
Say it.


00:32:00.671 --> 00:32:02.130
Our cell, what!


00:32:04.508 --> 00:32:05.384
Hey!


00:32:08.095 --> 00:32:10.180
One more bread, please?


00:32:12.641 --> 00:32:13.725
Just one.


00:32:15.352 --> 00:32:19.523
Think you're Jean Valjean? Crying over bread?


00:32:25.612 --> 00:32:28.782
Eat it, fool! I'm busy!


00:32:30.617 --> 00:32:32.828
Stuff down mine, too!


00:32:37.833 --> 00:32:38.876
Ye-sung!


00:32:44.381 --> 00:32:46.508
Weren't you scared?


00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:53.807
Got yourself a smart daughter. Daddy will be out soon.


00:32:54.683 --> 00:32:57.227
- Sure she's your daughter? - Yes!


00:32:58.103 --> 00:33:01.481
Lee Yong-gu's daughter, Ye-sung.


00:33:01.481 --> 00:33:03.192
Pretty Light OB-GYN.


00:33:04.109 --> 00:33:11.533
Born on December 23rd at 2:28 p.m. 2.1 kilograms.


00:33:14.369 --> 00:33:22.336
- What a little cutie! - Daddy? Why're you here? You're not a bad man. Daddy is not a bad man.


00:33:23.337 --> 00:33:28.592
This is a school. Not a bad place. Drink this.


00:33:29.134 --> 00:33:32.596
Not school. It's prison.


00:33:33.805 --> 00:33:35.098
All bad people.


00:33:35.807 --> 00:33:38.769
Daddy didn't do bad.


00:33:44.274 --> 00:33:47.361
If she's not gone in 2 hours, we're all dead!


00:33:53.283 --> 00:33:57.996
- Why're you leaving already? - The pastor fell over. High blood pressure.


00:33:59.581 --> 00:34:02.584
Out of my way!


00:34:04.127 --> 00:34:08.674
You said, two hours! It's only been 30 minutes!


00:34:08.674 --> 00:34:17.266
Yes! 30 minutes! I know, things like this happen all the time. - Go on! Hurry! - Yes. Goodbye.


00:34:18.016 --> 00:34:22.104
Not you! Ye-sung! - No! - No!


00:34:23.981 --> 00:34:26.483
Listen to me in my cell! Hey!


00:34:26.483 --> 00:34:27.943
Shut up!


00:34:28.986 --> 00:34:36.577
If you don't go out now, you gotta keep hiding. Then, you can't see your dad again! Quiet down!


00:34:38.036 --> 00:34:44.668
Daddy? Can't I stay here? No one knows. Yes. No one knows.


00:34:44.668 --> 00:34:51.758
But you have to go to school. You can't skip school. Come back on a holiday. He said, this was school!


00:34:53.010 --> 00:35:01.518
Not school. It's prison. All bad people. So, she should go to school! Want her to become like me? Or him!


00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:05.731
Or him? The hell!


00:35:05.939 --> 00:35:07.900
Or you? Stupid!


00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:13.238
Ye-sung must go to school.


00:35:13.864 --> 00:35:17.367
Come play again. No way! This isn't a playground!


00:35:19.244 --> 00:35:21.997
Uncle 1004 will bring you back.


00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:24.583
See you later.


00:35:27.002 --> 00:35:28.170
Promise!


00:35:31.006 --> 00:35:34.134
Promise her! Right. I promise.


00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:38.555
What the hell!


00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:43.060
Why invite a pastor about to croak!


00:35:43.936 --> 00:35:45.229
We can get hanged!


00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:07.125
- Eat up. - Okay.


00:36:10.838 --> 00:36:12.381
What the hell!


00:36:15.175 --> 00:36:19.721
How can you eat? Is it good? It's good.


00:36:20.514 --> 00:36:22.140
- Right? - Yeah.


00:36:23.016 --> 00:36:26.061
Ye-sung must eat beans. Lots of vitamins.


00:36:26.061 --> 00:36:31.984
I don't want beans. You have to! Open wide! Then, why'd you come here?


00:36:32.693 --> 00:36:35.195
The kid is eating more than our share!


00:36:37.906 --> 00:36:40.242
Boss! What now!


00:36:40.826 --> 00:36:47.875
It's easy to take things in, but hard to let 'em go. Cut the crap, Gramps!


00:36:48.458 --> 00:36:52.504
- Eat lots. - Boss? Let's fess up, boss.


00:36:52.504 --> 00:36:56.550
Let's fess up! If we do, who'd forgive us?


00:37:03.557 --> 00:37:07.686
- Ye-sung needs to poo? - Yup. Poop.


00:37:09.605 --> 00:37:12.274
Eating and pooping, too!


00:37:12.441 --> 00:37:14.610
What the hell!


00:37:17.279 --> 00:37:21.533
Let's eat. - Close the door! - Push!


00:37:27.539 --> 00:37:38.675
Let's send her out in two days. - Why then? - What's in two days? - A religious event. - It's the day He came. Chun-ho, you're good.


00:37:39.343 --> 00:37:41.220
A clever conman.


00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.430
It wasn't a con!


00:37:44.598 --> 00:37:46.558
- It's a treasure ship! - Gather around!


00:37:48.018 --> 00:38:02.324
Sneak her out in two days. Okay? Okay! Okay? For what? Why do you always huddle and mumble stuff? Don't huddle around! Got that? Yes, sir! Okay.


00:38:05.494 --> 00:38:08.664
Monica. I had a rough day.


00:38:09.623 --> 00:38:12.876
Sleep well. See you in my dream.


00:38:14.002 --> 00:38:17.464
Man-beom. Let's sleep.


00:38:25.597 --> 00:38:45.409
Sorry. It's cause I wanted the Sailor Moon bag. I'll buy Sailor Moon bag. Tell the judge clear and straight. Clear and straight. That you're not a bad person.


00:38:46.368 --> 00:38:48.161
Daddy's not a bad person.


00:38:53.458 --> 00:38:57.546
So pretty! Ye-sung is pretty.


00:38:58.172 --> 00:39:01.550
No, there! The stars and moon!


00:39:07.264 --> 00:39:08.182
Pretty.


00:39:17.316 --> 00:39:18.025
Boss!


00:39:19.776 --> 00:39:23.822
- Boss! - Ye-sung! Ye-sung!


00:39:25.574 --> 00:39:26.992
- The bathcell! - Not there!


00:39:26.992 --> 00:39:27.868
Ye-sung!


00:39:28.368 --> 00:39:30.329
No! Not there!


00:39:38.253 --> 00:39:39.338
Jesus Christ!


00:39:41.715 --> 00:39:42.925
What brings you here?


00:39:43.509 --> 00:39:52.851
What was that sound? What sound? Sleep talking? I heard a girl's voice! A girl's voice? Come on.


00:39:54.186 --> 00:39:57.356
You're scaring us. I heard a girl's voice! I swear!


00:39:57.981 --> 00:40:03.654
I wish I had a girl. Said stars and moon! Oh...him?


00:40:04.905 --> 00:40:06.073
Him what?


00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:09.034
Answer me now!


00:40:09.993 --> 00:40:11.161
What's this?


00:40:11.828 --> 00:40:14.456
Stars and Moon!


00:40:16.542 --> 00:40:22.840
Of all the crazy things... Just go back to sleep!


00:40:28.887 --> 00:40:34.434
- Chun-ho? - What? This is serious! - What's that? - Monica!


00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:52.661
Who! What! This is my favorite picture! Why! Ye-sung! Why! She looked cold, so I dressed her. - Cold? I don't believe this! - That's a violation of his rights! - Ye-sung? Who is that girl? - She's Sailor Moon!


00:40:53.787 --> 00:40:58.083
Sailor Moon? - Sailor Moon? - Who's Sailor Moon? What the...


00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.212
In the name of justice! I will punish you!


00:41:02.462 --> 00:41:08.594
So scary! The judges say that! - Then, Judge Moon? - Judge Moon.


00:41:09.219 --> 00:41:11.346
Don't you know this song?


00:41:12.014 --> 00:41:31.241
She will never turn her back on her friends She is always there to defend She is the one on whom we can depend - Quiet! - Sit down! She is the one named Sailor Moon What's with him! With secret powers all so new to her... Stop it! Sit down!


00:41:32.659 --> 00:41:33.994
Sit down!


00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:45.589
Sit! She is the one named Sailor Moon With secret powers all so new to her Hello, sir!


00:41:46.131 --> 00:41:51.970
She is the one named Sailor Moon Stay down!


00:41:52.721 --> 00:42:02.064
Fighting evil by moonlight Winning love by daylight Never running from a real fight


00:42:02.064 --> 00:42:04.816
- Perfect! Hallelujah! - Amen!


00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:23.669
I warned you to be careful with my lace briefs! She will never turn her back on a friend


00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:30.384
Okay.


00:42:36.348 --> 00:42:39.768
Ye-sung? Study hard. Take care!


00:42:40.561 --> 00:42:43.272
Amen! Amen! Go on.


00:42:51.947 --> 00:42:53.031
What?


00:42:59.663 --> 00:43:00.622
The hell?


00:43:06.128 --> 00:43:08.672
Why the monks!


00:43:16.346 --> 00:43:19.808
Can't tell from Buddha and Jesus!


00:43:21.768 --> 00:43:29.401
How embarrassing! Don't hit! You're scaring her. Get out now! - I can't! - Come out now!


00:43:29.401 --> 00:43:32.654
- I'm your right hand man! - Like hell!


00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:38.994
Chief? Can you choose a picture? What do I know about pictures?


00:43:39.453 --> 00:43:40.954
Still, sir.


00:43:42.122 --> 00:43:43.790
- Let me see. - Yes, sir.


00:43:44.875 --> 00:43:45.918
Here.


00:43:50.756 --> 00:43:52.883
How's the pastor?


00:43:52.883 --> 00:43:55.761
- He's feeling better. - That's good.


00:44:09.066 --> 00:44:15.364
Brainless conman! Think it over, boss. They search ten times a day!


00:44:15.364 --> 00:44:19.743
What if they suddenly come in? Then what?


00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.873
You should've shaved her head and sent her out!


00:44:24.873 --> 00:44:31.588
No! Ye-sung’s hair is pretty. Pretty hair. Pretty, my ass!


00:44:38.512 --> 00:44:41.974
Ye-sung! Stay still.


00:44:45.435 --> 00:44:46.395
Bastards.


00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:50.899
Why aren't you sleeping?


00:44:52.526 --> 00:44:57.281
Did you have dinner, sir? Of course. We just ate too, sir.


00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.076
Stay still, Yong-gu.


00:45:01.076 --> 00:45:03.620
- It was good. - Really?


00:45:04.413 --> 00:45:05.956
I liked it, too.


00:45:41.909 --> 00:45:50.209
She was there for 2 days and no one knew? I knew, sir! I heard a girl's voice saying, ‘Stars and Moon'.


00:45:51.376 --> 00:45:53.462
Search through all the cells!


00:45:53.795 --> 00:46:04.681
- Yes, sir! - Ye-sung! Where's Ye-sung? I put the child in the staff cell. Crazy! Send her out now! But it's raining, sir. Want to get fired!


00:46:06.016 --> 00:46:13.815
Yes, sir. It's raining a lot! Ye-sung will catch a cold! - A cold? - Yes. How can you say that!


00:46:14.274 --> 00:46:16.735
Ye-sung doesn't have an umbrella!


00:46:18.987 --> 00:46:21.865
You kill a girl and worry about your daughter!


00:46:25.953 --> 00:46:31.083
5482 didn't kill a girl.


00:46:36.672 --> 00:46:48.934
Boss? If we stay low, maybe they'll let us off. Shut up! Yes, sir. If we talk, some guards could get fired.


00:46:48.934 --> 00:46:50.686
We can't lose.


00:46:51.854 --> 00:46:55.399
Right! We're in the same boat as the guards.


00:46:55.399 --> 00:46:58.026
It's a joint operation.


00:46:58.443 --> 00:47:00.737
So smart.


00:47:01.238 --> 00:47:05.951
Joint operation? I like the sound of that.


00:47:06.743 --> 00:47:09.746
Ye-sung's father probably got solitary, right?


00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:20.299
Put ‘em down. Put your arms up, now! After how nice I treated you! - Come on, sir. - Don't suck up to me now!


00:47:25.012 --> 00:47:27.472
Ye-sung is scared.


00:47:30.184 --> 00:47:32.394
Ye-sung!


00:47:39.401 --> 00:47:40.652
You scared me!


00:47:42.446 --> 00:47:45.407
You can't come out here. Go back in.


00:48:32.663 --> 00:48:33.622
Chief!


00:48:34.289 --> 00:48:36.416
There's a fire!


00:48:43.549 --> 00:48:47.427
Baldy is freaking out! Be careful, sir!


00:48:48.595 --> 00:48:55.060
You let in someone's kid! Why not my dad! You're stopping him from coming! Aren't you!


00:48:56.812 --> 00:49:03.610
8038! We didn't let her in! Don't do this! My name is not 8038! Call me by name!


00:49:04.444 --> 00:49:16.373
Okay! Okay! Okay, Sang-myun. Please don't do this. Put that down. Don't order me around! I'm not listening to you bastards!


00:49:22.171 --> 00:49:29.887
Baldy! It's me, pal! Don't you want to go home? Put that down! Why should I!


00:49:31.096 --> 00:49:34.183
Send everyone out to the courtyard! Yes, sir!


00:49:40.731 --> 00:49:42.524
Come out, now!


00:49:50.866 --> 00:49:52.868
Damn it! Hey!


00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:58.999
Put that down! You stopped my dad from visiting! I'll call your father if you put that down!


00:50:02.836 --> 00:50:07.424
I want to see my dad! Put that down. I'll call him.


00:50:09.885 --> 00:50:12.888
Okay, fine! I'll put it down.


00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:21.396
Thanks, Chief. Thought I'd say that? Screw you! I'm an orphan! Bastards!


00:50:52.344 --> 00:50:57.599
Come out, fool! - You wanna die! - Stay back! Or you're dead!


00:51:04.398 --> 00:51:07.401
Stay back! Bastard! Don't come near me!


00:51:10.654 --> 00:51:13.782
There's someone there! Someone's there!


00:51:13.782 --> 00:51:16.994
- Someone's there! - Move!


00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:21.373
Someone needs help!


00:51:54.448 --> 00:51:56.200
Come to your senses?


00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.493
Oh man.


00:51:59.369 --> 00:52:04.082
What happened? You were damn lucky. That's what.


00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.296
If it wasn't for the weirdo, you could've had a funeral.


00:52:11.131 --> 00:52:12.090
Who?


00:52:18.055 --> 00:52:22.476
He must've took in a lot of gas carrying you out.


00:52:23.227 --> 00:52:29.066
But he cried like crazy... and begged me to save you.


00:52:30.651 --> 00:52:34.446
Is he really a kidnapper?


00:52:35.239 --> 00:52:37.157
He wasn't the one abducted?


00:52:40.536 --> 00:52:45.958
How I wonder what you are


00:52:46.375 --> 00:52:52.464
Up above the world so high


00:52:52.464 --> 00:52:54.216
Like a...


00:52:55.133 --> 00:52:56.510
Hello.


00:53:03.141 --> 00:53:05.143
- Take care. - Bye, Ms. Lee.


00:53:11.441 --> 00:53:12.276
Ye-sung?


00:53:15.279 --> 00:53:18.407
I was so worried about you.


00:53:18.824 --> 00:53:22.160
No one was living at your address.


00:53:23.203 --> 00:53:24.830
Did you move?


00:53:29.376 --> 00:53:30.711
Were you sick?


00:53:34.798 --> 00:53:38.385
I wish you can tell me what happened.


00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:42.556
Can you ask my daddy?


00:53:43.348 --> 00:53:45.934
What? Parent consultation?


00:53:49.438 --> 00:53:50.689
Oh, right.


00:53:50.772 --> 00:53:53.066
You have ID, right?


00:53:54.943 --> 00:53:56.236
ID?


00:54:07.372 --> 00:54:08.582
Daddy!


00:54:13.712 --> 00:54:14.796
Daddy!


00:54:15.714 --> 00:54:16.965
Ye-sung!


00:54:17.508 --> 00:54:24.640
- Daddy! - Ye-sung! Did you catch a cold? I'm all better now.


00:54:26.433 --> 00:54:32.481
Ye-sung is skinny. You, too. Daddy is okay. Ye-sung...


00:54:33.899 --> 00:54:35.526
This is my teacher.


00:54:37.819 --> 00:54:42.032
- Hello. - Hello. Please sit.


00:54:45.327 --> 00:54:50.916
Nice to meet you. I'm Ye-sung's teacher. So pretty.


00:54:52.793 --> 00:54:54.127
Ye-sung is pretty, too.


00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:56.255
Teacher is pretty, too.


00:54:57.381 --> 00:54:59.800
Nothing's wrong.


00:55:00.926 --> 00:55:03.387
It's just a parent consultation.


00:55:03.387 --> 00:55:09.560
Ye-sung is smart! She pays bills herself! First day of every month.


00:55:10.394 --> 00:55:43.177
From my monthly salary, $638.80... she puts $170 into savings. Pays health insurance on the 10th. Health insurance is... $5.50! Right! $5.50! I see. Ye-sung is the smartest and prettiest student in our class. - Ye-sung is the prettiest! - Ye-sung sings very well, too. Maybe she could join the school choir? Great!


00:55:45.012 --> 00:55:52.227
Bottom shelf of fridge? Pickled beans. Top shelf of fridge? Pickled radish from our neighbor.


00:55:53.645 --> 00:56:02.571
On top of the fridge? Instant noodles. Boil water for 3 minutes. Put an egg in. Okay! Daddy...


00:56:04.573 --> 00:56:17.961
I can't hear! It's broken! No! Please! Please! Ye-sung! Daddy? Daddy!


00:56:18.504 --> 00:56:19.963
What's happening?


00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:22.007
Ye-sung! Eat lots!


00:56:22.007 --> 00:56:24.760
You're skinny! Eat beans! You're skinny, too!


00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.680
- Eat beans! Vitamin! - You too, Daddy! Ye-sung!


00:56:31.225 --> 00:56:53.080
I'll be home soon! - Wait for me at home! - When are you coming? I'll be home soon! 10 nights! Just come tomorrow! See you soon! Just come today! See you soon, Ye-sung!


00:57:27.364 --> 00:57:31.034
We get sunlight once a day. Don't sit here like this.


00:57:33.787 --> 00:57:37.416
Get up and exercise. You'll get sick.


00:57:44.381 --> 00:57:50.053
Lee Yong-gu's daughter is in the hospital.


00:57:52.723 --> 00:57:54.391
She won't eat anything.


00:57:55.434 --> 00:57:57.311
I knew this would happen.


00:57:58.937 --> 00:58:01.523
We can no longer take care of her.


00:58:03.525 --> 00:58:07.571
A countryside orphanage would have funds to take her.


00:58:16.788 --> 00:58:18.040
Mister?


00:58:21.168 --> 00:58:24.254
I don't want to go far away.


00:58:27.216 --> 00:58:31.553
Can't you just arrest me, too?


00:58:33.722 --> 00:58:34.723
Please?


00:58:44.691 --> 00:58:48.278
Chief, I think this is a mistake.


00:58:48.278 --> 00:58:49.571
This is wrong.


00:58:49.571 --> 00:58:53.992
He'll take responsibility. So what! We'll all get fired!


00:58:53.992 --> 00:58:58.705
- I'm going to farm. - What? Come farm with me.


00:58:59.373 --> 00:59:00.332
What?


00:59:00.791 --> 00:59:03.377
Chief! Chief!


00:59:04.837 --> 00:59:06.547
I'm not going to farm!


00:59:09.758 --> 00:59:13.387
Philopon. PHILO-PON Poncho! PON-CHO


00:59:13.387 --> 00:59:18.684
Go easy. Choker. CHO-KER


00:59:18.684 --> 00:59:23.397
What's that? Stupid fool! A tight fitting necklace.


00:59:23.397 --> 00:59:27.776
CHO-KER Acting all smart!


00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:37.661
Kersa. KER-SA Sashimi. SA-SHIMI Mineral.


00:59:45.252 --> 00:59:46.920
Ralking! RAL-KING


00:59:49.548 --> 00:59:51.425
Can I play Word Chain, too?


00:59:54.178 --> 01:00:01.393
Is today a special day? Why the rice cakes? It's especially for cell no.7 while the warden is away.


01:00:02.519 --> 01:00:03.600
Ye-sung.


01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:12.154
- It says, ‘rice cakes'. - It's Ye-sung. You say that over every box. Let's eat.


01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:14.031
Daddy!


01:00:15.324 --> 01:00:16.450
Ye-sung!


01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:23.540
What the! - It's the Chief. - The Chief? Stupid! It's not rice cakes!


01:00:28.378 --> 01:00:29.338
Chief?


01:00:30.255 --> 01:00:33.175
Did he go to the staff cell?


01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:37.638
Yong-gu? Wait here, please. Yes.


01:00:39.515 --> 01:00:42.059
Where did he go?


01:01:07.084 --> 01:01:08.418
What are you doing?


01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.380
Hello, sir.


01:01:13.632 --> 01:01:14.883
Put that down.


01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:22.724
Cookies are tasty.


01:01:27.104 --> 01:01:28.063
Get out.


01:01:33.235 --> 01:01:36.822
I didn't bring Ye-sung for you. Leave.


01:01:43.871 --> 01:01:44.580
Leave!


01:01:45.247 --> 01:01:46.081
Yes.


01:01:46.665 --> 01:01:48.083
Take care, sir.


01:01:52.713 --> 01:01:53.714
Yes?


01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:56.967
Why'd you kill her?


01:02:03.307 --> 01:02:08.562
You read it, Uncle. You have the best voice here.


01:02:09.021 --> 01:02:20.240
We even get to see you read thanks to Ye-sung. Never saw him read once in 7 years together. Please?


01:02:21.909 --> 01:02:23.410
Let's see.


01:02:24.411 --> 01:02:26.955
There's a butterfly.


01:02:28.207 --> 01:02:33.587
I had one drawn on my thigh. But I erased it with an iron.


01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:38.842
There's one butterfly, right? It's a loner.


01:02:38.842 --> 01:02:49.228
And look! It meets a mouse. Come on, boss! Don't say stuff like ‘loner' to the kid. It's not like you're illiterate.


01:02:50.687 --> 01:02:52.231
Come on.


01:02:52.397 --> 01:02:54.608
Who can't read these days?


01:02:55.192 --> 01:02:57.277
- That makes no sense. - Fine. Keep playing.


01:02:58.779 --> 01:03:04.993
Even chimpanzees can learn to read in 3 months! Okay! Fine!


01:03:07.746 --> 01:03:10.749
A fool who can't read is no human!

01:03:10.749 --> 01:03:22.052
Know what the illiteracy rate is? There's no one like that here! Get your facts straight! Okay, fine. Who doesn't know how to read? That's crazy!


01:03:22.052 --> 01:03:24.847
Fine! Don't get excited and play!


01:03:24.847 --> 01:03:26.390
I'm not in the mood!


01:03:27.015 --> 01:03:29.476
- Why you little! - Who can't read!


01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:36.859
On a cold winter day, a yellow butterfly came out. Sneak one in for me.


01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:38.861
What?


01:03:41.154 --> 01:03:45.409
Ye-sung snuck in. So sneak in my baby, too!


01:03:46.994 --> 01:03:51.915
This isn't daycare! One kid is enough!


01:03:53.125 --> 01:04:07.055
With special amnesty gone... too bad, pal. Look, boss! Look! 21 weeks. It'll be born soon! Read it! I'm not reading! Shut up.


01:04:09.558 --> 01:04:12.477
Can't read or make kids. Like you'd understand.


01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:15.105
You fools are asking for it!


01:04:16.148 --> 01:04:20.319
- Why ask him to read? - What's with you?


01:04:20.736 --> 01:04:22.487
Want the baby in that bad?


01:04:22.487 --> 01:04:24.448
Yes! Come here.


01:04:27.034 --> 01:04:31.496
Then, get the death sentence.


01:04:34.708 --> 01:04:36.502
I should just die.


01:04:42.257 --> 01:04:57.523
Of course I remember! It was crazy! Everyone was out at dawn. The Commissioner General's daughter died! Minister of Home Affairs ordered to wrap up the case in a week! - Captain Park? - Yes, sir?


01:04:58.065 --> 01:05:00.192
Can I see Lee Yong-gu's file?


01:05:03.987 --> 01:05:05.155
No, sir.


01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:07.824
Give it to me.


01:05:09.159 --> 01:05:14.498
Sir, I'm a law-abiding cop. LEE YONG-GU


01:05:19.044 --> 01:05:23.924
Did Lee Yong-gu really write this?


01:05:24.758 --> 01:05:27.094
Not sure. I wasn't in charge of that.


01:05:29.096 --> 01:05:30.347
I need a copy of this.


01:05:31.348 --> 01:05:33.767
Sir! That's impossible!


01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:38.647
Then, I'll just take it. Come on, sir!


01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:42.776
You can't! I could get fired.


01:05:45.612 --> 01:05:48.699
After everything, still don't get it?


01:05:49.533 --> 01:05:53.036
It's cuz of bastards like him your son died!


01:05:56.081 --> 01:06:02.379
It's smaller than my dad's! - Is this real? - Of course it's fake! It's real.


01:06:03.172 --> 01:06:04.715
Can I touch it?


01:06:05.799 --> 01:06:07.467
Don't press ‘Send'.


01:06:11.513 --> 01:06:12.848
What's ‘Send'?


01:06:25.235 --> 01:06:27.863
Mister! Thanks Young-hoon!


01:06:40.209 --> 01:06:48.675
G...r...a...p...e...s. - That's it! - Well done! You can do it.


01:06:49.885 --> 01:06:53.430
Next, ‘apple'. Apple.


01:06:56.225 --> 01:06:59.770
- You practiced a lot. - That's it. Good!


01:07:00.229 --> 01:07:02.397
Now, the rest.


01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:06.902
You can do it. Go on.


01:07:07.236 --> 01:07:10.280
‘Ple' as in ‘pled'. Right!


01:07:13.784 --> 01:07:22.793
Uncle! That says, ‘ape'. Stupid. Apple is ‘a-p-p-l-e'. You left out a ‘P' and ‘L'!


01:07:23.418 --> 01:07:33.011
You practiced for days! Can't even do that? ‘P' and ‘L'. - Can't remember? - Even Yong-gu knows! - ‘P' and ‘L'. - He doesn't remember!


01:07:45.274 --> 01:07:47.651
Right! Well done!


01:07:49.611 --> 01:07:50.696
Bastard!


01:07:56.285 --> 01:08:01.039
Now, you can go to school. If I knew how to read, I'd be a prosecutor.


01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:07.045
Cheer up. She'll write to you soon.


01:08:09.047 --> 01:08:16.597
It's hard for women, after giving birth. No energy to write.


01:08:24.146 --> 01:08:25.147
Uncle?


01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:34.656
What's this? Hey!


01:08:37.034 --> 01:08:41.580
Where'd you get this? I borrowed it from Young-hoon. Is it a toy?


01:08:42.873 --> 01:08:45.959
We can't have it in here, but... Hurry up!


01:08:47.044 --> 01:08:48.253
Try it!


01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:56.220
- Pull out the antenna! - Right!


01:08:57.471 --> 01:09:01.308
- There's no signal. - What? - I can't! - Try over there!


01:09:03.435 --> 01:09:07.439
- There's no signal, boss! - Why not?


01:09:08.148 --> 01:09:11.902
- Ye-sung? - Go by the window! The window!


01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:17.157
Is it working? - It's ringing! - Yes! Hello?


01:09:17.741 --> 01:09:27.668
Hello? - Who's this? - Hello? Another prank call? Sun-nyuh? It's me! It's her! Honey? Sun-nyuh!


01:09:29.461 --> 01:09:33.966
I had the baby, honey. - Stop crying. - You stop crying.


01:09:34.758 --> 01:09:37.719
Hello? It's not working again!


01:09:39.012 --> 01:09:41.098
Quiet down or we're dead!


01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:45.394
- Why isn't it working! - Hold it up higher!


01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.063
Stop!


01:09:48.647 --> 01:09:52.734
Get back! Wanna get killed? Get back!


01:09:59.157 --> 01:10:12.629
There's a signal! It's working! Can you hear me? The signal's strong! The baby's crying! Tell it to say, ‘daddy'! Daddy? Right! Baby? It's your daddy!


01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.212
It's giggling.


01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.759
Is it healthy?


01:10:18.427 --> 01:10:23.307
Has all 10 fingers and toes? The baby looks like you. Fit to be a general. Really?


01:10:24.183 --> 01:10:26.518
Is it a son? It's a girl.


01:10:27.311 --> 01:10:29.563
Boss! It's a girl.


01:10:31.356 --> 01:10:32.608
A girl like me!


01:10:34.651 --> 01:10:35.903
Oh shoot.


01:10:36.195 --> 01:10:55.380
Hello? Are you... I'm barely surviving, you know. I can't talk long. The battery's dying! What about the baby's name? The baby's name? Put your name and hers together. What?


01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:04.056
It's Bong-sun. Shin Bong-sun. Poor kid. Looking like her father. - I love you, honey. - I love you too.


01:11:07.684 --> 01:11:08.936
Done? Good.


01:11:10.395 --> 01:11:13.190
Ye-sung! Thank you!


01:11:13.857 --> 01:11:15.484
- Don't cry. - Stop crying!


01:11:15.484 --> 01:11:20.531
Is Young-hoon your boyfriend? - Yes. - Is he cool? He's reassuring.


01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:27.996
You're reassuring to me. - So reassuring! - Stop it!


01:11:28.622 --> 01:11:34.545
You're the most reassuring. I was so fast, you couldn't see my fists!


01:11:39.049 --> 01:11:40.092
Good!


01:11:40.634 --> 01:11:44.888
Yong-gu! Hello. Your trial date is set.


01:11:46.348 --> 01:11:51.103
Last trial for a verdict hearing. Do good on your last chance. Do a good job.


01:11:55.399 --> 01:11:58.402
It's no time to be running!


01:11:59.653 --> 01:12:02.155
Yong-gu! Crazy fool!


01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:39.985
She just fell?


01:12:39.985 --> 01:12:42.571
And died just like that?


01:12:43.322 --> 01:12:46.617
Yes. That's really weird.


01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:50.454
How was she lying on the ground?


01:12:52.748 --> 01:12:55.834
Just fallen down. It was scary.


01:12:57.419 --> 01:13:04.384
What if someone else killed her to steal the Sailor Moon bag? Cut the crap, fool!


01:13:07.721 --> 01:13:14.353
So, when you went there she was just lying? Yes. - For no reason? - Yes.


01:13:21.026 --> 01:13:35.082
Think it could kill you? My arm! It hurts! Right! Arms! People usually fall arm first. Right! But her back of the head cracked.


01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:37.918
How'd that happen?


01:13:45.384 --> 01:13:48.470
The Sailor Moon bag!


01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:49.471
Right!


01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:51.807
The Sailor Moon bag.


01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.938
She was skipping like this?


01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:06.071
Right! It's the bag!


01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:09.491
What was the date on that day?


01:14:10.409 --> 01:14:20.669
February 27th, 1:15 p.m. During lunch break. Okay! February 27th... That day was our bath day!


01:14:22.713 --> 01:14:24.047
What the!


01:14:24.047 --> 01:14:30.220
There's no water. Turn the water on! The pipes froze over so we couldn't take showers!


01:14:32.139 --> 01:14:35.434
- Right! It was -18°C! - Yeah!


01:14:36.518 --> 01:14:38.353
She slipped on ice!


01:14:41.398 --> 01:14:43.358
That's it, boss!


01:14:43.358 --> 01:14:51.658
There's water everywhere in the markets. That's right! Then, what about the wound on the kid's forehead?


01:14:52.492 --> 01:14:55.871
There was a brick next to her?


01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:59.082
Yes. There was a brick. A brick?


01:15:01.084 --> 01:15:04.755
- Wait... - A brick? While she fell...


01:15:18.352 --> 01:15:21.480
I'm dying here!


01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.734
But why'd you pull her pants off?


01:15:27.402 --> 01:15:37.371
First, loosen the pants to help blood circulation. - Blood circulation? - Yes. Then, why'd you strangle her? I didn't.


01:15:38.455 --> 01:15:39.581
Second...


01:15:40.207 --> 01:15:42.584
Press the chest vertically.


01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:55.180
Next... Free the airway and block the nose. Breathe in 12 times a minute.


01:16:01.937 --> 01:16:17.035
- Good job. - Yes. Next? Wake up! Wake up! Are you okay? - Wake up! - Good. Shake the patient to gain consciousness. Next?


01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:21.206
Pinch or slap.


01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:55.532
- Don't hit for real, sir! - He's alive. - Damn it! - Right. He's alive. Now, let's follow along. Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation. - Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation. - That's right. - CPR. Right. - Of course! It was the Commissioner General's kid. And it's no fun drawing blame on the market. Pressure to solve the case all around them! Yong-gu got talked into taking the blame!


01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.702
Shoot! We'll do Yong-gu's trial!


01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:05.459
I object!


01:17:06.293 --> 01:17:13.592
The witnesses claim only circumstantial evidence. The witnesses testified to only what is true.


01:17:14.343 --> 01:17:16.011
Really?


01:17:20.766 --> 01:17:22.643
- Mr. So? - Yes?


01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.479
What did you do in life?


01:17:28.857 --> 01:17:32.444
Hallelujah. I'm a pastor. I mean your past. What?


01:17:33.862 --> 01:17:42.287
I'm not sure when you are referring to. I also made clubs with friends to play soccer. Weren't you a gangster?


01:17:43.872 --> 01:17:58.804
What? Your Honor! - His past is irrelevant to... - And you? Mr. Choi? I've always been interested in sunken treasure ships. - Charged on 7 accounts of fraud? - I object!


01:17:59.555 --> 01:18:02.724
Bringing up the witnesses' past is irrelevant to this case.


01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:04.351
Overruled.


01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:23.954
Can we trust testimonies from men who served sentences? Look, Brother... I mean, Prosecutor? Is there a law... that states testimonies from former inmates can't be trusted?


01:18:24.872 --> 01:18:26.957
- No, but... - So, tell me!


01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:33.547
Is there a law that says folks like us always lie!


01:18:38.093 --> 01:18:39.845
No, there isn't.


01:18:39.845 --> 01:18:45.475
- No further examination. - You mean questions! We're not suspects here!


01:18:49.021 --> 01:18:50.314
Order!


01:18:50.314 --> 01:18:51.398
I apologize.


01:18:52.733 --> 01:19:03.076
Defense? Do you have another witness? As the prosecution requests, he has no criminal record. Rather, he has worked hard for the country.


01:19:03.869 --> 01:19:06.038
I call the prison Chief at the time to the stand.


01:19:07.831 --> 01:19:09.458
- Let's go. - Sure.


01:19:26.308 --> 01:19:28.894
I am Jang Min-hwan Chief of Security at Prison.


01:19:30.145 --> 01:19:33.106
- One of our inmates... - How is he?


01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:40.405
Eating three meals a day.


01:19:43.408 --> 01:19:45.327
Exercising when it's time.


01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.163
When it's past 9:00 p.m...


01:19:49.665 --> 01:19:51.416
he'll probably sleep.


01:19:53.794 --> 01:19:54.962
Commissioner?


01:19:56.088 --> 01:20:00.175
I know it's not my place, but please re-investigate the case.


01:20:01.885 --> 01:20:03.929
Then, he'll walk free after his term.


01:20:07.349 --> 01:20:08.642
Am I wrong?


01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:13.564
Lee Yong-gu...


01:20:16.316 --> 01:20:17.568
He's innocent, sir.


01:20:23.198 --> 01:20:24.408
A child...


01:20:26.493 --> 01:20:28.036
Ever lost one?


01:20:34.877 --> 01:20:36.253
Yes, I have.


01:20:40.299 --> 01:20:42.050
To an inmate I cherished.


01:20:50.475 --> 01:20:57.232
Defendant? Did you abduct the Commissioner's daughter to get revenge?


01:20:59.818 --> 01:21:04.860
Yes. I followed her. Sailor Moon bag store.


01:21:05.199 --> 01:21:10.370
Daddy! Just read what the uncles wrote. Read it!


01:21:13.248 --> 01:21:19.630
Ji-young said she'd show me a store that sells Sailor Moon bags.


01:21:19.630 --> 01:21:28.013
So, I just followed her. - That's it. - Good! Did you pull her pants off to sexually abuse her? Did you?


01:21:28.805 --> 01:21:32.059
First, loosen pants for blood circulation. Good!


01:21:34.269 --> 01:21:37.314
Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation.


01:21:38.023 --> 01:21:46.990
I don't remember. Did you hit Choi Ji-young with a brick to kill her? No. Ji-young fell and...


01:21:49.201 --> 01:21:50.536
- Yong-gu! - Oh my!


01:21:50.994 --> 01:21:52.788
When you can't remember, what do you say?


01:21:54.665 --> 01:21:55.624
I...


01:21:59.127 --> 01:22:01.380
don't remember. That's good.


01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:02.673
- I don't remember. - Good.


01:22:02.673 --> 01:22:09.179
Remember... - Happy! Happy! - Happy, Happy Happy Mart. That's good! A brick fell on her head.


01:22:09.179 --> 01:22:15.018
- Did you see it? - No, I didn't. Come on, pal! - Just pretend you know! - That's right!


01:22:15.185 --> 01:22:18.146
Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation...


01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:23.902
Yong-gu! Yes? Do it in the morning.


01:22:24.319 --> 01:22:25.320
Yes.


01:22:27.489 --> 01:22:31.034
Your Honor...


01:22:31.702 --> 01:22:38.292
I am intellectually impaired.


01:22:39.626 --> 01:22:42.504
The scary policemen hit me.


01:22:44.756 --> 01:22:46.091
They didn't investigate.


01:22:46.675 --> 01:22:58.145
- PETITION- Read this over. - What is it? - Here. I wrote it myself! Pass the pens! Don't spill on it. Write clearly. Sign it.


01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:03.817
They said if I signed, they'll send me home to Ye-sung.


01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:07.362
And buy me the Sailor Moon bag.


01:23:07.362 --> 01:23:08.488
And so...


01:23:10.032 --> 01:23:12.159
the written statement...


01:23:14.912 --> 01:23:17.206
is all fabricated.


01:23:17.206 --> 01:23:20.709
Perfect! You win! Daddy! Good job!


01:23:23.712 --> 01:23:31.803
- Yong-gu! - Yes? Your lawyer is here to see you. Yes? Is this a prison or daycare!


01:23:32.846 --> 01:23:36.850
Anything you'd like to eat? I can get it for you.


01:23:38.101 --> 01:23:39.311
Free Time!


01:23:40.145 --> 01:23:43.482
The chocolate bar? Yes, tasty Free Time.


01:23:44.066 --> 01:23:47.022
You have a daughter. Ye-sung?


01:23:47.361 --> 01:23:50.781
Yes. Ye-sung is pretty.


01:23:51.907 --> 01:23:54.618
- Listen to me carefully. - Yes.


01:23:55.202 --> 01:23:59.081
The girl's father is the police commissioner.


01:23:59.081 --> 01:24:00.249
Yes.


01:24:01.041 --> 01:24:02.709
Damn...


01:24:04.294 --> 01:24:05.712
You know! The police!


01:24:06.922 --> 01:24:11.593
Yes, police. Very scary. He's the leader of the scary men!


01:24:12.219 --> 01:24:17.224
He's totally out of it! He could harm Ye-sung!


01:24:18.892 --> 01:24:20.060
Yes.


01:24:20.853 --> 01:24:23.564
How frustrating.


01:24:24.523 --> 01:24:25.774
Mr. Lawyer?


01:24:26.733 --> 01:24:27.860
Mr. Lawyer?


01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:33.782
Here are our inmates' petitions.


01:24:35.659 --> 01:24:37.953
These things don't really help.


01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.418
Even a public lawyer should show dedication!


01:24:45.878 --> 01:24:47.838
It still won't lessen his sentence.


01:24:51.049 --> 01:24:52.176
Look!


01:24:52.634 --> 01:24:57.431
Look at this! Lee Yong-gu is not smart enough to write this!


01:24:58.056 --> 01:24:59.808
Still think he's the culprit!


01:25:20.204 --> 01:25:21.914
Think of Ye-sung...


01:25:22.915 --> 01:25:24.625
and stay focused.


01:25:26.293 --> 01:25:27.294
Yes.


01:25:28.253 --> 01:25:29.880
I must go home.


01:25:30.797 --> 01:25:31.840
Right.


01:25:33.634 --> 01:25:36.094
You can go home. Don't worry.


01:25:36.845 --> 01:25:39.181
Got that? Yes.


01:25:44.561 --> 01:25:52.402
Ji-young said she knew a store that sold the Sailor Moon bag.


01:25:55.113 --> 01:25:56.740
So, I followed her.


01:25:58.742 --> 01:26:02.496
But Ji-young suddenly fell.


01:26:12.047 --> 01:26:19.805
Speak clearly to the judge. Speak clearly.


01:26:22.099 --> 01:26:27.688
He wanted revenge on the Commissioner for getting hit.


01:26:28.021 --> 01:26:31.900
So, you abducted his daughter Ji-young, correct?


01:26:36.947 --> 01:26:46.123
I repeat. Did you abduct Choi Ji-young? You must die for Ye-sung to live. You get it?


01:26:46.456 --> 01:26:48.166
You're the father.


01:26:50.335 --> 01:26:58.385
When Ji-young resisted sexual assault... you killed her with a brick, correct?


01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.768
I repeat the question.


01:27:07.311 --> 01:27:10.522
Did you strike Choi Ji-young with a brick?


01:27:13.192 --> 01:27:14.151
Defendant!


01:27:15.485 --> 01:27:17.029
Answer the question.


01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:23.911
Accept your punishment.


01:27:26.163 --> 01:27:31.210
If not, I'll do the same to your daughter.


01:27:48.519 --> 01:27:50.187
Answer the question.


01:27:51.563 --> 01:27:52.606
Yes.


01:27:57.444 --> 01:28:07.412
When Ji-young resisted sexual assault... you killed her with a brick, correct?


01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:15.504
I repeat the question.


01:28:16.046 --> 01:28:19.633
Did you strike Choi Ji-young with a brick?


01:28:27.808 --> 01:28:30.394
Did you kill her with a brick?


01:28:34.356 --> 01:28:40.279
- Defendant! - Yes. Did you kill her with a brick? Yes, I did.


01:28:43.156 --> 01:28:49.872
Bastard! Think your kid will be fine! I'll kill your kid, too!


01:28:54.334 --> 01:28:55.627
Ji-young!


01:28:58.046 --> 01:28:59.798
I'll kill your kid, too!


01:29:08.432 --> 01:29:12.144
Yes. I did it. I did it.


01:29:14.062 --> 01:29:16.982
Lee Yong-gu! What are you saying!


01:29:17.524 --> 01:29:19.067
Come to your senses!


01:29:19.735 --> 01:29:27.618
Your Honor, the defendant is psychologically intimidated. Order! You're his lawyer! Do something!


01:29:29.745 --> 01:29:53.852
I killed her. I did. Are you out of your mind! You didn't kill anyone! She died because of me. I'm sorry. Very sorry. Why're you sorry! No one apologized to you! Why are you so sorry! If you speak out, you'll be ordered to leave. Please help my Ye-sung. My daughter.


01:29:53.852 --> 01:29:56.480
- Order! - I did it.


01:30:20.712 --> 01:30:22.422
What are you doing!


01:30:24.633 --> 01:30:25.926
You're a lawyer!


01:30:27.386 --> 01:30:29.680
A lawyer can't be like this!


01:30:35.769 --> 01:30:42.943
The police only took the witness accounts... and dismissed the defendant's denials.


01:30:43.652 --> 01:30:50.868
Lee's statement was fabricated by force from the police. Also!


01:30:50.868 --> 01:30:57.457
Ji-young did not die of the brick wound... but an occipital injury! That too was dismissed!


01:30:58.292 --> 01:31:04.381
Contrary to police claims that Lee strangled her...


01:31:04.381 --> 01:31:12.764
her autopsy showed no sign of strangling whatsoever! Defense? Give your final argument.


01:31:14.057 --> 01:31:15.517
Your Honor.


01:31:16.226 --> 01:31:19.855
I request for leniency.


01:31:21.523 --> 01:31:23.775
The prosecution's demand?


01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:29.740
The defendant admitted to the charges.


01:31:30.115 --> 01:31:37.247
I request the same sentence to the defendant as the first trial.


01:31:41.752 --> 01:31:43.003
Your Honor!


01:31:43.504 --> 01:31:52.095
The investigation is biased. It was only forcibly done to establish a crime.


01:31:52.095 --> 01:31:54.890
They dismissed the principle of presumed innocence!


01:31:55.849 --> 01:32:00.896
They abused the defendant's mental disability... and love for his daughter


01:32:01.605 --> 01:32:04.358
to force him to give up on everything!


01:32:05.692 --> 01:32:15.827
The innocent defendant was sacrificed at their convenience! As the defendant admitted to the charges, the trial is adjourned.


01:32:16.662 --> 01:32:22.209
The defendant's appeal is rejected.


01:32:22.209 --> 01:32:25.420
The first trial's sentence stands.


01:32:26.296 --> 01:32:31.093
Defendant Lee Yong-gu is sentenced to death.


01:32:38.684 --> 01:32:39.726
Thank you.


01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:43.230
Thank you.


01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:46.316
Thank you.


01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.737
I was wrong.


01:32:56.243 --> 01:32:58.704
Please help Ye-sung.


01:33:02.165 --> 01:33:03.584
It's my fault.


01:33:07.921 --> 01:33:09.882
And so, I defend...


01:33:14.136 --> 01:33:17.181
a man wrongfully sentenced to death...


01:33:19.183 --> 01:33:24.771
to clear defendant Lee Yong-gu's false accusations.


01:33:26.773 --> 01:33:28.066
That is why...


01:33:30.485 --> 01:33:32.196
I am here today.


01:33:35.199 --> 01:33:38.410
His wife said, I can take piano lessons.


01:33:39.203 --> 01:33:41.747
Piano?


01:33:42.497 --> 01:33:51.507
The Chief has a piano at home. Daddy, I'll play it for you later. Piano? I like piano.


01:33:52.549 --> 01:33:56.845
Daddy? You're not a bad man, right?


01:34:02.267 --> 01:34:03.602
- Yong-gu? - Yes.


01:34:06.605 --> 01:34:07.648
Take care.


01:34:10.734 --> 01:34:14.738
One, two, three!


01:34:28.961 --> 01:34:32.256
See? Isn't cooking fun?


01:34:32.256 --> 01:34:39.179
It'd be easier to eat out. Ye-sung makes this a special Thanksgiving.


01:34:39.513 --> 01:34:42.599
Ye-sung made this pretty one.


01:34:45.143 --> 01:34:46.353
You too, Mister.


01:34:48.564 --> 01:34:52.317
It's from Ye-sung!


01:34:54.903 --> 01:34:57.406
Hi, Daddy.


01:34:58.282 --> 01:35:03.787
How are you? - Is it from Ye-sung? - Letter from Ye-sung!


01:35:03.787 --> 01:35:05.956
Let me see!


01:35:07.082 --> 01:35:11.920
Tada! 100! Ye-sung got perfect!


01:35:14.214 --> 01:35:18.177
Good job! Bong-sun should be a model when she grows up.


01:35:18.927 --> 01:35:19.970
Funny.


01:35:21.054 --> 01:35:22.723
Baby looks funny.


01:35:24.016 --> 01:35:27.686
- He's way too honest. - I'm sorry.


01:35:30.647 --> 01:35:44.995
Fall on your knees Hear the angel voices


01:35:44.995 --> 01:35:50.417
Night divine


01:35:50.918 --> 01:35:55.380
Hello...


01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:59.510
Uncle...


01:36:01.178 --> 01:36:11.766
Uncle 1004, hello! Are you studying hard? I'm dying to hear you read to me soon. I hope you get along well with Daddy and the others. Take care. From Ye-sung! It's been hours!


01:36:17.903 --> 01:36:19.696
Hello...


01:36:20.239 --> 01:36:25.494
Shouldn't we prepare something for the annual talent show?


01:36:26.119 --> 01:36:30.207
That's a bunch of lies. If we place first, will they let us out?


01:36:31.083 --> 01:36:34.586
Yeah! One night out with family.


01:36:34.586 --> 01:36:39.091
Really? - Disgusting! - Ye-sung! How about singing?


01:36:39.091 --> 01:36:45.889
Yes, singing! Sailor Moon! Good idea! - She will never turn her back… - Cut that out!


01:36:49.852 --> 01:36:54.439
Sir? There are more Christmas amnesties this year.


01:36:56.441 --> 01:36:58.527
Due to presidential elections?


01:36:59.236 --> 01:37:01.613
Right, the elections.


01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:05.367
Lots to send off, too.


01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:11.665
Pardon?


01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:15.043
The date's been set for 5482.


01:37:15.586 --> 01:37:17.296
December 23rd.


01:37:23.218 --> 01:37:24.803
- Spider. - Louder.


01:37:25.095 --> 01:37:26.972
- Spider. - Louder.


01:37:27.264 --> 01:37:28.473
Spider!


01:37:28.724 --> 01:37:30.809
- What about this? - This?


01:37:32.436 --> 01:37:38.025
Philippines. Morphine? No, it says ‘Hairpin'!


01:37:41.612 --> 01:37:43.864
You read that already!


01:37:47.034 --> 01:37:48.744
So weak in the head!


01:37:50.537 --> 01:37:51.830
Stop it!


01:37:54.917 --> 01:37:58.795
Ye-sung


01:38:00.881 --> 01:38:04.092
I can't decide that on my own.


01:38:05.385 --> 01:38:09.181
I'll need permission from the principal.


01:38:09.181 --> 01:38:10.933
This is the last time.


01:38:12.184 --> 01:38:13.227
Pardon?


01:38:17.105 --> 01:38:19.483
That Ye-sung can see her father.


01:38:21.735 --> 01:38:23.570
Please help.


01:38:25.948 --> 01:38:27.407
I'm begging you.


01:38:32.037 --> 01:38:35.791
Pretty. Damn it!


01:38:35.958 --> 01:38:39.378
Why's the execution so soon after the trial?


01:38:40.003 --> 01:38:50.597
This should be protested. It goes completely against existing laws! I should be the one to go first.


01:38:51.223 --> 01:38:54.726
Everyone in the prison deserves to go before him.


01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:03.443
Yong-gu... We can't let him go like this.


01:39:05.028 --> 01:39:06.947
Hey, Chun-ho! Yes?


01:39:20.377 --> 01:39:25.716
Oh no! What's going on! I'm sorry. Why'd this break?


01:39:26.175 --> 01:39:27.301
Take them quick!


01:39:30.012 --> 01:39:30.929
Ouch!


01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:34.474
It's saving a man's life.


01:39:34.808 --> 01:39:37.561
Only if you give me your turf.


01:39:41.982 --> 01:39:43.775
One!


01:39:44.943 --> 01:39:46.570
The hell!


01:39:47.529 --> 01:39:48.071
Two!


01:40:01.627 --> 01:40:02.711
Gotcha!


01:40:06.632 --> 01:40:08.342
You're working?


01:40:09.468 --> 01:40:11.303
Carry on, then.


01:40:14.097 --> 01:40:19.728
You heard? If you think this is your father, please come up.


01:40:19.728 --> 01:40:23.273
Do it right. It's to save a life. Got it?


01:40:23.273 --> 01:40:24.066
Yes, boss!


01:40:27.361 --> 01:40:34.785
Where are the boys? It's taking long to blow up the big thing. You sure he's your father?


01:40:38.747 --> 01:40:40.123
You said, you're an orphan.


01:40:44.753 --> 01:40:48.257
All the fathers in the world are my father!

01:40:51.009 --> 01:40:53.136
Go Cell 7! Go!


01:41:18.245 --> 01:41:33.093
O holy night The stars are brightly shining It is the night of the dear Savior's birth


01:41:36.388 --> 01:41:51.153
Long lay the world In sin and error pining Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth


01:41:52.446 --> 01:41:59.661
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices


01:41:59.661 --> 01:42:27.606
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn Fall on your knees Hear the angel voice Night divine


01:42:28.607 --> 01:42:41.954
Night when Christ was born Night divine


01:42:42.704 --> 01:42:45.874
Night divine Everything's all set?


01:42:45.874 --> 01:42:50.087
Don't worry. Ye-sung's teacher's on our side.


01:42:53.215 --> 01:43:01.098
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus praise we


01:43:01.098 --> 01:43:07.896
Let all within us praise His holy name


01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:13.277
Daddy? Hand.


01:43:14.695 --> 01:43:15.904
Hold hands.


01:43:17.155 --> 01:43:20.492
- Hurry up! - Hold hands!


01:43:22.202 --> 01:43:23.287
Hold!


01:44:16.924 --> 01:44:18.300
Let's go!


01:44:18.759 --> 01:44:19.635
Let's go!


01:44:24.181 --> 01:44:28.101
Chun-ho! Get him out! Yong-gu! Hurry!


01:44:37.653 --> 01:44:42.533
Get them off! Get ‘em out!


01:44:43.992 --> 01:44:45.160
Get them in!


01:44:53.168 --> 01:44:54.044
Untie it!


01:45:12.271 --> 01:45:15.983
Daddy! We're flying! We're flying!


01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:23.490
Daddy, people are so tiny.


01:45:25.993 --> 01:45:30.831
- They can't leave! - Chief... We're flying like birds! We're flying!


01:45:31.707 --> 01:45:35.294
Goodbye uncles! Get them! Stop ‘em!


01:45:37.754 --> 01:45:39.256
Stop ‘em!


01:46:07.117 --> 01:46:08.869
Look over there!


01:46:10.454 --> 01:46:12.623
People are dancing!


01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:18.587
Get them!


01:46:24.259 --> 01:46:26.011
What are you doing up there?


01:46:26.011 --> 01:46:28.180
Hello, Mister!


01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:30.516
Ah, hello!


01:46:30.766 --> 01:46:34.770
The sunset is pretty! Yes, it is.


01:46:35.187 --> 01:46:37.564
Goodbye!


01:46:40.901 --> 01:46:42.861
Daddy! Look over there!


01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:45.197
Over there!


01:46:45.197 --> 01:46:50.118
- Daddy? Are we going home? - We're going home! I'm so happy!


01:48:08.739 --> 01:48:09.865
Ye-sung...


01:48:10.824 --> 01:48:12.034
Yes, Daddy?


01:48:14.453 --> 01:48:15.621
Don't forget.


01:48:17.831 --> 01:48:19.124
What, Daddy?


01:48:20.417 --> 01:48:21.460
Today...


01:48:24.588 --> 01:48:26.215
And...Daddy.


01:48:42.856 --> 01:48:46.610
DECEMBER 23rd


01:48:52.533 --> 01:48:56.411
Eat lots! Is it good? - Yes, it's yummy. - It's yummy.


01:48:57.579 --> 01:49:02.167
Eat beans! Vitamins! - Get ready. - Yes, boss.


01:49:05.712 --> 01:49:09.341
Tada! A cake!


01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:13.095
Blow out the candles. One, two, three!


01:49:15.264 --> 01:49:16.431
All blown out!


01:49:18.934 --> 01:49:20.185
Happy birthday!


01:49:20.978 --> 01:49:23.647
Present! Thank you!


01:49:24.982 --> 01:49:28.652
Draw lots of pretty pictures! Thank you!


01:49:29.278 --> 01:49:30.779
Did I spell right?


01:49:32.155 --> 01:49:34.783
This is from me. Thank you!


01:49:35.617 --> 01:49:37.327
Yong-gu? Give her yours.


01:49:40.289 --> 01:49:44.751
What is it? It's big! It's really big!


01:49:48.630 --> 01:49:50.507
Sailor Moon!


01:49:52.092 --> 01:49:53.343
It's pretty.


01:49:54.303 --> 01:49:56.680
You're so lucky! It's pretty!


01:50:00.392 --> 01:50:01.351
Yes?


01:50:06.315 --> 01:50:10.485
Thank you for being my daddy.


01:50:17.868 --> 01:50:21.121
Go on. Say something.


01:50:31.089 --> 01:50:35.969
Thank you for...


01:50:37.262 --> 01:50:38.931
being my daughter.


01:50:53.237 --> 01:50:55.697
What did they put in the soup?


01:50:57.199 --> 01:50:58.867
Uncle? Are you crying?


01:51:00.786 --> 01:51:02.329
He's not crying.


01:51:03.163 --> 01:51:05.207
Hold on. Right! Ye-sung?


01:51:08.752 --> 01:51:09.962
Watch this.


01:51:09.962 --> 01:51:11.171
What are you doing?


01:51:13.006 --> 01:51:14.842
Hold still!


01:51:14.842 --> 01:51:16.134
It tickles!


01:51:20.806 --> 01:51:26.311
- You call that writing? - It's cuz he's moving. - Write good! - Nice drawing.


01:52:02.806 --> 01:52:04.224
I'd better go.


01:52:09.104 --> 01:52:10.606
Take care.


01:52:16.111 --> 01:52:17.362
Take care.


01:52:21.283 --> 01:52:22.451
Thank you.


01:52:24.661 --> 01:52:26.246
Thank you.


01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:30.042
Thank you.


01:54:00.924 --> 01:54:08.807
Ye-sung can go without Daddy, right?


01:54:08.807 --> 01:54:12.436
Yup. You can go alone, right?


01:54:14.938 --> 01:54:16.064
Yes.


01:54:17.858 --> 01:54:21.820
I'll get many perfect scores and come and see you.


01:54:22.863 --> 01:54:28.285
When you go to a better place, don't worry about me. Okay!


01:54:29.661 --> 01:54:32.497
Daddy! Merry Christmas!


01:55:02.236 --> 01:55:04.988
You too, Ye-sung. Merry Christmas!


01:55:07.741 --> 01:55:08.825
Take care.


01:55:21.672 --> 01:55:23.632
Ye-sung? Okay.


01:55:39.857 --> 01:55:41.525

01:55:42.067 --> 01:55:46.154
Goodbye, Ye-sung! Bye. Ye-sung! Bye!


01:56:09.178 --> 01:56:10.512
Ye-sung! Bye!


01:56:11.513 --> 01:56:12.472
Bye.


01:56:14.641 --> 01:56:16.018
Ye-sung! Bye!


01:56:32.284 --> 01:56:36.663
One, two, three.


01:56:40.209 --> 01:56:46.840
One, two, three.


01:56:52.679 --> 01:56:53.889
Daddy!


01:56:54.264 --> 01:56:55.474
Daddy!


01:56:56.016 --> 01:56:57.267
Daddy!


01:57:05.984 --> 01:57:07.569
Ye-sung!


01:57:14.826 --> 01:57:16.912
Help me!


01:57:18.539 --> 01:57:20.082
I was wrong!


01:57:21.667 --> 01:57:28.173
Daddy! What's wrong! - Help me! - What's wrong, Daddy!


01:57:28.173 --> 01:57:31.927
- Ye-sung! - What's wrong? I was wrong!


01:57:32.803 --> 01:57:34.346
Please, help me!


01:57:34.888 --> 01:57:38.350
Don't cry. You can live here for a long time.


01:57:39.309 --> 01:57:46.066
I'll come and visit! I won't get mad! Don't go to a better place!


01:57:48.485 --> 01:57:50.696
Ye-sung!


01:57:54.366 --> 01:57:57.327
- I was wrong! - Daddy!


01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:59.496
I was wrong!


01:58:02.875 --> 01:58:06.170
I'm sorry! I was wrong, sir!


01:58:06.795 --> 01:58:10.799
I'm sorry! Please, help me! I was wrong, sir!


01:58:11.091 --> 01:58:12.301
Daddy!


01:58:15.429 --> 01:58:16.972
I'm sorry!


01:58:18.182 --> 01:58:19.683
I was wrong!


01:58:23.061 --> 01:58:25.098
I was wrong!


01:58:25.898 --> 01:58:27.274
I'm sorry!


01:58:29.193 --> 01:58:31.320
I was wrong!


01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:34.281
Daddy!


01:58:51.548 --> 01:58:53.675
I'm here for defendant Lee Yong-gu.


01:58:56.887 --> 01:58:57.971
No...


01:59:00.349 --> 01:59:03.268
My dad whom I loved most in the world.


01:59:04.811 --> 01:59:06.897
For my angelic father.


01:59:12.861 --> 01:59:16.949
The defense gives the final argument.


01:59:21.745 --> 01:59:23.288
In the name of justice...


01:59:27.084 --> 01:59:28.168
I will...


01:59:30.796 --> 01:59:31.922
forgive...


01:59:34.132 --> 01:59:35.509
my father.


02:00:05.581 --> 02:00:14.756
Defendant Lee Yong-gu's disability is recognized. He was threatened and beaten by the police.


02:00:15.674 --> 02:00:19.386
The court accepts he was forced to confess.


02:00:20.888 --> 02:00:23.348
According to testimonies...


02:00:24.266 --> 02:00:27.269
there is not enough evidence...


02:00:27.269 --> 02:00:32.858
that he abducted, sexually abused, then killed Choi Ji-young.


02:00:42.576 --> 02:00:45.746
The court remands this case...


02:00:46.371 --> 02:00:49.625
and overturn Lee's death sentence...


02:00:50.292 --> 02:00:55.380
and demands a re-investigation. The court finds Lee Yong-gu...


02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:57.549
not guilty!


02:02:03.323 --> 02:02:09.746
- Ye-sung! - Hello! It's Daddy! Ye-sung! Daddy's here!


02:02:13.375 --> 02:02:14.459
Daddy?


02:02:15.752 --> 02:02:19.673
- Goodbye, Ye-sung! - Goodbye!


02:02:22.593 --> 02:02:30.517
Goodbye, Daddy. - Goodbye! - Ye-sung, goodbye! I love you! - Ye-sung, I love you! - Goodbye!


02:02:32.436 --> 02:02:35.981
Eat your beans! Vitamins!


02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:39.985
I love you, Ye-sung! Goodbye!


02:02:42.404 --> 02:02:43.947
I love you!


02:02:44.865 --> 02:02:47.242
I love you, Daddy!


02:02:49.494 --> 02:02:50.746
Goodbye.
