Seduces stupid girls
Says he's from Pennsylvania

7
00:01:24.877 --> 00:01:27.462
He wants to be a star

No resort at the bird sanctuary!
No resort at the bird sanctuary!
Stop it right now!

12
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:36.448
Hey.
Why are you so late?
Sorry, boss.
The traffic was bad.
Damn bastards!
- Hurry.
- Yes, sir.

13
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.827
- Where the hell are you going?
- I hate that bastard...
You, beanpole!

14
00:02:42.246 --> 00:02:44.164
Yes, you, I asked
where you're going!

15
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.875
Damn bastard, focus!

16
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.337
You think this is a joke?
What is wrong with you?

17
00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:53.841
He's got asthma,
sorry boss.

18
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.719
What am I supposed to do
with these losers? Damn it.

19
00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:09.356
Save Asan Bay!
Save it!
Strike them!
Stop the construction!
Stop it!
Stop it now!
Stop the resort construction
right now!

20
00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.275
Stop it right now!

21
00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.987
Stop the construction!
Save the bay!

22
00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:32.004
If you cross the police line...
we can arrest you for violating
the assembly law.
What the hell...?
You just violated the law!

23
00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:36.008
Drop your weapon!

24
00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:41.889
Drop your weapon!

25
00:03:43.307 --> 00:03:47.477
It's the final warning.
You can be arrested on site.

26
00:03:54.234 --> 00:04:00.365
You little...
You can be arrested on site.
You just violated the law!

27
00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:05.996
Stop them!

28
00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:09.750
Stop them!
Don't let them through!

29
00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:14.421
Block them!
Stop them!

30
00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.302
They sure do work hard.

31
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:46.912
At the Asan Bay bird sanctuary,
where Far East Construction
is trying to build
its largest resort,
there was major bloodshed today
between police and an NGO.
Having occupied the site
for over 50 days,
100 environmental activists
resisted police enforcement
using iron pipes
and other weapons.
Some extreme members acted
with illegal violent force

32
00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:49.748
turning the bird sanctuary
into a lawless area.

33
00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:59.967
In the crackdown,
combat officer Lee Jae-seung
was struck on the head
with a blunt weapon
and is still unconscious.

34
00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:05.931
NGO member Lee Jin-seok
who struck the policeman
was apprehended by police.

35
00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.561
So are you going to
keep acting up like this?

36
00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:14.773
I've told you 100 times,
I know nothing about this.

37
00:05:15.274 --> 00:05:16.817
You disguised gangsters

38
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:22.155
as environmental activists
to turn the protest violent!

39
00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:26.869
There's circumstantial evidence
that funds from your company
went to a gang.

40
00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:33.208
Who the hell wants to trap me?
- You know I originally...
- Hey, Jang Hyun-seok.

41
00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:39.464
The bastard who hit the
cop's head is coming in soon.

42
00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:44.553
A few words with him,
and you're done.

43
00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.348
Why are you talking so much?

44
00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:54.897
Please check these.
Prosecutor Byun,
are you issuing a ruling
before the trial?

45
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.817
I'm still an innocent citizen.
You know well!

46
00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:06.617
How dare you
raise your voice?
Who's behind you?

47
00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:10.162
Nobody's behind me.
It's a hard life for everyone.

48
00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:16.502
I guess you've been really lucky
meeting only generous
prosecutors so far.

49
00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:18.045
Sir.

50
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:25.594
Haven't you ever thought
that your passion might block
your path to success?

51
00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:28.805
A cornered stone meets
the mason's chisel...

52
00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:31.517
What the hell?

53
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.520
This is violation of human rights!

54
00:06:34.937 --> 00:06:36.522
Violation of human rights?

55
00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:38.649
You damn bastard...

56
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:40.734
Come here.
Stand straight.

57
00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:45.781
Three years preparing!
Four years at college!

58
00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:49.284
Four years of
cramming for the exam!

59
00:06:52.663 --> 00:06:58.001
You know why I slaved 11 years
to become a prosecutor?

60
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:06.426
To legally kick the gangsters like you!
You know that?

61
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.350
I know your current situation.

62
00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:17.646
But let's not see this
as a political matter.

63
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.858
Byun has caused
lots of problems already.

64
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:26.238
People upstairs
have their eye on this.
I got your point, sir.

65
00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:34.413
WOO JONG-GIL
I will handle the case myself
not to cause any inconvenience
to the people upstairs.

66
00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:43.964
Congressman,
it's me, Min-woo.

67
00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:45.632
Let me pour you a drink.

68
00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:49.386
Oh, I'll pour you
the nice stuff.

69
00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:56.185
It made me so proud
watching you conduct
the government offices inspection.

70
00:07:56.935 --> 00:08:02.191
Those bastard ministers
didn't know a thing.
Absolutely.
They only took Civil Service Exam.

71
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:06.278
Hey, Byun Jae-wook.
What is wrong with you?

72
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.702
After all the trouble you caused,
you hit a suspect again?

73
00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:17.748
I'm sorry, Chief.
It was my mistake.

74
00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:21.835
Next time,
I'll beat him so hard

75
00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:25.506
that he'll beg for his life
and not bother us anymore.

76
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:26.965
You bastard.

77
00:08:29.468 --> 00:08:32.387
You think others don't use
violence 'cause they can't?

78
00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:39.728
We are administers of law.
What would happen
if we ignore due process?

79
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.190
Sometimes...

80
00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.735
you only can fix bad habits
with a beating.

81
00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:48.737
Enough.

82
00:08:50.322 --> 00:08:55.202
Lee Jin-seok came in today
for police assault.

83
00:08:58.372 --> 00:08:59.957
Let Yang handle it.

84
00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:03.001
No, sir.

85
00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:09.883
We have to beat Lee to get Jang,
and we have to beat Jang.
to get those politicians related to
the bird sanctuary development.

86
00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:17.432
- What is wrong with him?
- I'm sorry, sir.
We've had a hard time
because of him...

87
00:09:30.863 --> 00:09:36.660
Go get some fresh air.
We were told to turn over
this case to Prosecutor Yang.

88
00:09:37.703 --> 00:09:39.538
I said get out!

89
00:09:59.892 --> 00:10:03.270
You smashed a cop's head
with an iron pipe

90
00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:07.399
but the pipe
wasn't originally from that site.

91
00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:11.612
We were there
to protect the environment.

92
00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.366
Protect nature?

93
00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.827
Environmental activism is great.

94
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:25.584
But you know what?
After you hit him...
public opinion
is now pro-development.

95
00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:31.673
Don't you think
something smells fishy?

96
00:10:32.591 --> 00:10:38.347
It was a mistake that
happened in a chaotic situation.
Many of us were hit too.

97
00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:45.103
What group do you belong to?
Pardon?

98
00:10:45.312 --> 00:10:48.106
You don't even know
the name of your organization?

99
00:10:48.232 --> 00:10:49.942
Listen, sir.

100
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:57.574
Once migratory birds leave Russia,
they keep flying for 15 days
without landing or eating...

101
00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:03.205
The bird sanctuary is the place
where those birds stop by
to eat and rest.

102
00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:06.124
If we develop this habitat

103
00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:09.211
the birds would come and all die.

104
00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:12.464
One species of bird
will go extinct.

105
00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.760
You have a good memory.

106
00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:19.596
Who wrote that line for you?

107
00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.182
I knew it myself.

108
00:11:27.813 --> 00:11:29.189
Listen, Lee Jin-seok.

109
00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:34.486
A middle school graduate turned into
an environmental activist?

110
00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:41.827
You want me to believe it?
So an undereducated ex-convict
can't protect nature?

111
00:11:41.827 --> 00:11:43.078
Take off your shirt.

112
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.831
I don't want to.

113
00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:48.375
I said take it off!
No, I won't.

114
00:11:49.835 --> 00:11:51.795
What is wrong with you?
Please!

115
00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:56.341
- Stand up. Attention!
- Please let me go...
Stand straight!
Straight!

116
00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:01.722
Take off your shirt!

117
00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:04.308
Why should I...

118
00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.064
I said take it off!

119
00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.504
Look at you, brat!

120
00:12:34.505 --> 00:12:37.508
Look at this nice
artwork on your body!

121
00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:39.676
You bastard.

122
00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:44.515
You claim to be an activist
when you have this
big tattoo on your body?

123
00:12:50.187 --> 00:12:52.564
You'll never get out of here.

124
00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:57.778
I'll search out everyone
related to you.
Everyone.

125
00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:03.909
Hey, wake up.
Jae-wook!

126
00:13:07.204 --> 00:13:09.081
I told you not to
mess with me!

127
00:13:11.542 --> 00:13:16.797
What the hell
are you talking about?
I heard you locked up
Lee Jin-seok all day long!

128
00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:24.888
Are you trying to screw me?
Why are you bothering me
so early in the morning?
Stop that nonsense
and return him to me.

129
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:31.728
I won't stand here and
let you screw us over.
All right,
just let me sleep 5 more mins.

130
00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:36.066
I stayed up all night!

131
00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.194
Damn it.

132
00:13:43.574 --> 00:13:44.783
Morning!

133
00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:51.623
Where are night shifters?
Why is the monitor off?
- Bastards...
- Don't know.
- Get ready quick.
- Yes, sir.

134
00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:02.134
Hey!
Wake up, Mr. Lee!

135
00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:04.678
Rise and shine!

136
00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:07.764
Let's wrap this up
and have breakfast!

137
00:14:23.614 --> 00:14:24.740
Lee Jin-seok.

138
00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.118
Hey you!

139
00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:29.870
Lee Jin-seok!

140
00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:34.541
Chief Kang!
- Answer me!
- Yes, sir.

141
00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:39.129
What's wrong with him?
What happened last night?
I don't know...
I didn't do the night shift.

142
00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.924
Call him quick!
Hurry!

143
00:14:53.727 --> 00:15:02.027
You have the right to
remain silent
and the right to an attorney.
Anything you say
can and will be
used against you
in a court of law.

144
00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:05.489
D.A. Byun Jae-wook, arrested
without warrant for murdering

145
00:15:05.531 --> 00:15:08.367
a police assault suspect,
exits the prosecutor's office.

146
00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:16.959
The case relates to a dispute
over developing
the bird sanctuary...
Shockingly, the prosecutor killed
the suspect during his interrogation.

147
00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:25.425
Citizens are demanding a
transparent and fair investigation
into the practices
that caused this incident.

148
00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:30.138
Dear citizens.

149
00:15:30.514 --> 00:15:33.600
As Deputy Chief Prosecutor
I sincerely apologize

150
00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:42.651
for the foul play of Byun Jae-wook
and accept full
responsibility for this.

151
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:56.790
Did the defendant
directly order the witness
to leave the interrogation room?

152
00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:06.966
Yes.
Prosecutor Byun
ordered me himself.
The defendant Byun claims that
the victim died of asthma-related
breathing difficulties.

153
00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:08.177
Is it correct?

154
00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:10.846
No way.

155
00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:14.975
Jin-seok was sound as a bell.

156
00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:19.479
Defendant Byun Jae-wook
had previously caused trouble

157
00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:23.358
both internally and externally
with his violent tactics.

158
00:16:24.443 --> 00:16:32.034
His mistaken views
about governmental power
led to this criminal act of
assault and homicide,

159
00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:36.788
undermining public trust
in the prosecution as a whole.

160
00:16:37.623 --> 00:16:39.958
To re-establish justice
and the rule of law

161
00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:43.629
using this case as an example,

162
00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:48.717
we hereby ask for
15 years imprisonment.

163
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.431
Look at him!

164
00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:57.559
You're so screwed,
Mr. Prosecutor.

165
00:17:02.523 --> 00:17:04.274
Lift your damn head up.

166
00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:08.570
Remember me?
I'm the Iron from Gunsan.

167
00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:19.665
Here, sir.

168
00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:27.297
The human body is so mysterious.

169
00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:31.051
All because of
this small object...

170
00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:13.969
Take off your shoes.

171
00:18:33.739 --> 00:18:35.199
Look who's here.

172
00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:37.910
It's been a while, sir.

173
00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:42.372
Never expected
to see you like this.

174
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.212
Damn, you scared me.

175
00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:52.466
Why no answer?

176
00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:55.928
At least pretend to listen
when people talk to you.

177
00:18:57.095 --> 00:19:04.102
I think I gave you 20 years total.
First, 3 years for special robbery
and then 17 years for murder.
Great.

178
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.815
Excellent memory!
So smart!

179
00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.693
From Seoul University, right?

180
00:19:13.237 --> 00:19:15.822
Let's exchange greetings
since we'll be together so long.

181
00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:20.077
Of course.
Greetings.

182
00:19:20.786 --> 00:19:23.539
You guys give him
good greetings.
Let's go.

183
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.251
Bastard!

184
00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:32.089
- I said 'don't move!'
- Hold that bastard.

185
00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:40.931
You'll spend
your whole life with me!

186
00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:42.432
Isn't that nice?

187
00:19:43.392 --> 00:19:44.393
Damn bastard!

188
00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:47.729
You must be damn happy!
Here he comes!

189
00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:51.608
Nice.

190
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.945
What's all the fuss for?

191
00:19:57.072 --> 00:20:00.909
We're exchanging greetings
with the newbie.

192
00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:03.036
Cool it now and
get ready for roll call.

193
00:20:03.287 --> 00:20:04.788
Yes, sir.

194
00:20:10.002 --> 00:20:19.219
Three, two, one.
One!
Three, two, one.
Two!
Three, two, one.
Three!
Three, two, one.
Four!
Three, two, one.
Five!

195
00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:25.100
Three, two, one.
Six!
Three, two, one.
Seven!
Don't stare,
you idiot!

196
00:20:27.728 --> 00:20:32.065
You want to get smart, bastard?
You think you're a prosecutor
in here too?

197
00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:41.825
What is it?

198
00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:43.243
Let me see.

199
00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:47.331
Bring the bandage!

200
00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:55.339
The long-delayed development
- of the Asan Bay Bird Sanctuary
- Focus!
resumed today with
a groundbreaking ceremony.

201
00:20:55.672 --> 00:21:06.642
Alongside President Jang
of Far East Construction,
Congressman Kang Young-seop
and Woo Jong-Gil,
ex-deputy prosecutor,
attended the ceremony.

202
00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:37.798
I've worked as a prosecutor
for 8 years!
Long enough to know
if it was a plot.
I'm being made a scapegoat
to cover up the habitat case!

203
00:21:40.384 --> 00:21:47.558
The so-called witnesses
are all lying,
and Min-woo is acting
like a crazy man.
It's like everyone
wants to bury me alive.

204
00:21:48.684 --> 00:21:51.270
So?
The thing is...

205
00:21:53.814 --> 00:21:58.527
I'm absolutely sure that
Lee Jin-seok had his inhaler!

206
00:21:59.403 --> 00:22:05.617
If we can find it,
it would solve this case.
Didn't you hear the testimony
that he never had asthma?

207
00:22:06.285 --> 00:22:08.161
You keep saying
the same damn thing!

208
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:12.958
All the evidence
points to you as the murderer.

209
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.838
Then what do you want me to do?

210
00:22:21.842 --> 00:22:24.386
First, plead guilty.

211
00:22:25.137 --> 00:22:29.683
Then we'll say the victim
acted rashly under interrogation,

212
00:22:30.225 --> 00:22:31.685
and claim self-defense.

213
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.356
You want me to admit to this?

214
00:22:37.858 --> 00:22:39.151
Listen, Jae-wook.

215
00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.529
This isn't the truth
I'm talking about...

216
00:22:43.322 --> 00:22:49.912
it's the way of the law.
Sir!
This is the only way

217
00:22:52.039 --> 00:22:53.624
I can get you out of this.

218
00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:55.042
Now, the verdict.

219
00:22:55.709 --> 00:23:00.756
We recognize the defendant's
service to the cause of justice.

220
00:23:01.131 --> 00:23:04.760
But his abuse of power
leading to the victim's death

221
00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:09.181
is too serious a crime
to be forgiven.

222
00:23:09.473 --> 00:23:12.518
Furthermore, we find
no evidence to support

223
00:23:12.935 --> 00:23:15.312
the defendant's claim
of self-defense.

224
00:23:16.355 --> 00:23:20.692
Therefore, believing in
the need to raise an alarm

225
00:23:21.151 --> 00:23:25.822
over the illegal investigations
of the prosecution and police,

226
00:23:26.365 --> 00:23:29.660
we find the defendant guilty,

227
00:23:30.077 --> 00:23:35.082
and sentence him to
15 years in prison.

228
00:23:42.172 --> 00:23:53.642
Chief, this isn't
what you told me!
What's going on?
Chief!
- Jae-wook, stop it!
- Chief!
What the hell are you doing to me?
Answer me!
Let me go!

229
00:23:53.976 --> 00:23:56.144
Tell me why
you're doing this to me!

230
00:23:56.603 --> 00:23:58.313
Tell me!

231
00:23:58.814 --> 00:23:59.898
Let go of me!

232
00:24:00.148 --> 00:24:01.733
Woo Jong-Gil!
Damn it.

233
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.402
Tell me the reason!

234
00:24:04.403 --> 00:24:05.946
Why did you do this to me!

235
00:24:13.912 --> 00:24:16.290
Yes, sir.

236
00:24:16.498 --> 00:24:18.458
I'll take care of it myself.

237
00:24:19.126 --> 00:24:22.212
Thank you.
I'm counting on you.

238
00:24:28.427 --> 00:24:31.471
No. 3820.
Warden wants to see you.

239
00:24:55.495 --> 00:24:59.416
Every man in this jail
believes that he's innocent.

240
00:24:59.625 --> 00:25:02.211
Rather than upset people upstairs,

241
00:25:02.461 --> 00:25:05.881
you'd be better off
getting used to it here, okay?

242
00:25:26.318 --> 00:25:28.820
It's cold. Let's hurry.

243
00:25:29.905 --> 00:25:33.075
Attention!
Gather here.

244
00:25:36.495 --> 00:25:41.166
Raise your hand
if any of you has experience
in real estate.

245
00:25:42.459 --> 00:25:44.294
What did you do?

246
00:25:44.378 --> 00:25:47.923
I was a contractor
and illegal real-estate broker.

247
00:25:49.299 --> 00:25:51.468
It means you were a con-man!

248
00:25:54.137 --> 00:25:55.138
What did you do?

249
00:25:56.348 --> 00:25:59.059
The same broker?
I'm sorry, sir.

250
00:25:59.309 --> 00:26:01.186
My enthusiasm got the best of me.

251
00:26:02.938 --> 00:26:07.276
I'm the idiot for expecting
anything out of you.
Forget it.
Back to work!

252
00:26:09.862 --> 00:26:12.155
Not one guy here
who can help me.

253
00:26:12.573 --> 00:26:15.409
What'll I do?
It's quite a big lawsuit,

254
00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:17.911
and what do I know
about the law?

255
00:26:18.245 --> 00:26:20.497
- Captain Im.
- Who the hell is this?

256
00:26:20.581 --> 00:26:22.040
On the outside,

257
00:26:22.291 --> 00:26:24.918
I handled a few
real-estate disputes in court.

258
00:26:25.711 --> 00:26:30.757
That's right!
You're the one!
Why didn't I think of you?

259
00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:33.510
We have a specialist here.

260
00:26:39.766 --> 00:26:41.977
So this would solve everything?

261
00:26:42.144 --> 00:26:44.438
- It's that simple?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:26:45.105 --> 00:26:47.107
Then the other party

263
00:26:47.649 --> 00:26:50.694
will be arrested for evasion
under property transfer law.

264
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.865
So he'll offer you a settlement.

265
00:26:55.115 --> 00:26:58.285
Then you get your money back,
plus a cancellation fee.

266
00:27:01.079 --> 00:27:03.624
May I have one more?
Of course, go ahead!

267
00:27:03.665 --> 00:27:05.250
Take your time.

268
00:27:05.292 --> 00:27:15.135
A while back,
I lost a civil suit to my uncle
so I need to pay.
Yes, right.
But as you know well,
civil servants like us
have no money...

269
00:27:17.513 --> 00:27:22.601
- Don't pay him.
- Really?
Is it okay not to?
The court ordered me to pay.

270
00:27:23.769 --> 00:27:26.271
What do those jerks know?

271
00:27:26.396 --> 00:27:28.524
I'll settle it for you.

272
00:27:32.152 --> 00:27:33.695
In return...

273
00:27:35.822 --> 00:27:37.366
could you do me a favor?

274
00:27:40.369 --> 00:27:42.287
Really nice, bro.

275
00:27:43.622 --> 00:27:47.709
You dance much better
than the pros!
Nice move!

276
00:27:52.297 --> 00:27:56.635
No. 1322, you're transferred.
Why all of a sudden?

277
00:27:58.053 --> 00:27:59.096
What is it?

278
00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:00.681
Wait!

279
00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:05.602
What is it?

280
00:28:07.938 --> 00:28:09.231
Why are you doing this?

281
00:28:10.482 --> 00:28:12.276
At least tell me the reason!

282
00:28:12.568 --> 00:28:17.739
Please tell me!
Where the hell
are you sending me?

283
00:28:17.781 --> 00:28:20.701
At least tell me where!
Let me go!

284
00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.874
Damn bastard, let me go!

285
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:10.417
Newbies!
Good to meet you!
See you inside.

286
00:29:13.128 --> 00:29:15.297
Hey, don't stare at me!

287
00:29:18.842 --> 00:29:20.135
Left face!

288
00:29:20.844 --> 00:29:22.137
March ahead!

289
00:29:26.475 --> 00:29:27.809
See you soon.

290
00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:48.872
Honey, are you alright?
How do you feel?

291
00:29:49.289 --> 00:29:50.999
You're okay, right?

292
00:29:58.257 --> 00:29:59.716
Why are you saying that?

293
00:30:00.926 --> 00:30:03.637
You really don't know why?

294
00:30:04.137 --> 00:30:06.640
Honey, don't do this to me!

295
00:30:07.432 --> 00:30:12.563
I'm no longer good enough
for a sweet girl like you.

296
00:30:14.898 --> 00:30:19.278
Forget about an ex-con like me
and live a happy life.

297
00:30:21.697 --> 00:30:23.407
That's what I came out to say.

298
00:30:25.617 --> 00:30:26.827
Honey.

299
00:30:29.705 --> 00:30:33.333
I'm done with the visit!
Wait, honey! Please!

300
00:30:42.426 --> 00:30:44.720
I know you don't belong here.

301
00:30:45.012 --> 00:30:47.181
I know it all.

302
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:52.477
The person I know
is too pure-hearted
and innocent for this!
Stop it, Hanna.

303
00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.898
I'm stupid.
I'm a fool!

304
00:30:56.148 --> 00:31:00.152
All I did in the US was study.
I don't know
the ways of the world.

305
00:31:03.155 --> 00:31:05.282
I believed everything
Koreans told me.

306
00:31:05.365 --> 00:31:12.956
I think the world
misunderstood you.
No!
What misunderstanding?
Don’t you see this?

307
00:31:12.956 --> 00:31:14.917
The world will never recognize me!

308
00:31:15.209 --> 00:31:17.461
Do you think your family

309
00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:21.423
will approve a scumbag like me?

310
00:31:21.465 --> 00:31:22.966
You're not a scumbag!

311
00:31:23.383 --> 00:31:25.260
I can overcome everything.

312
00:31:26.887 --> 00:31:31.892
My dad will give me
his new building.

313
00:31:32.518 --> 00:31:33.936
We can start small with it

314
00:31:34.353 --> 00:31:36.772
when you come out, okay?

315
00:31:41.985 --> 00:31:44.947
You're unbelievable.

316
00:31:46.323 --> 00:31:48.075
How did I ever find

317
00:31:50.035 --> 00:31:52.621
a girl like you
in this dirty world?

318
00:31:54.831 --> 00:31:55.958
Honey.

319
00:32:04.675 --> 00:32:06.802
- Get rid of all his gang.
- Yes, sir.

320
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:34.204
Who was it?
I heard a chick visited you.

321
00:32:34.913 --> 00:32:35.998
I envy you!

322
00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.125
- Tell me the secret!
- Yeah, tell us!

323
00:32:40.252 --> 00:32:45.340
The difference between
you guys and me
is that you think too much.

324
00:32:47.593 --> 00:32:52.556
Fraud is not about cheating
others and ruining them.

325
00:32:53.473 --> 00:32:55.100
It's leaving yourself behind.

326
00:32:55.767 --> 00:32:59.438
It's just making yourself into
the person you want to be.

327
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.651
We brought him.

328
00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.614
Who the hell are they?

329
00:33:09.072 --> 00:33:11.867
You don't know?
He's the prosecutor in cell 9.

330
00:33:12.075 --> 00:33:14.161
Sir...

331
00:33:17.289 --> 00:33:19.124
I'm not a criminal.

332
00:33:20.125 --> 00:33:23.879
Then what are you?
One of my staff
raped my daughter.

333
00:33:24.171 --> 00:33:26.965
How could a father
turn his back on that?

334
00:33:27.799 --> 00:33:29.593
Don't look at me when you talk

335
00:33:30.177 --> 00:33:31.178
Pardon?

336
00:33:36.975 --> 00:33:40.062
So I called in several
Yanbian Koreans.

337
00:33:42.689 --> 00:33:44.441
So you are a criminal.

338
00:33:49.696 --> 00:33:50.739
Sir.

339
00:33:51.406 --> 00:33:53.992
I heard quite a lot about him.

340
00:33:54.618 --> 00:33:59.831
He's facing big difficulties now.
But he has a great reputation.
- Tell him to come.
- Yes.

341
00:34:00.582 --> 00:34:03.836
You can talk to his face now.
Please help me, sir.

342
00:34:05.003 --> 00:34:10.759
Does the prosecutor have proof
that the Yanbian Koreans asked for money?
No, sir.

343
00:34:11.468 --> 00:34:17.641
Then just find some other
Yanbian Koreans
and make them testify
you didn't order them to kill him.

344
00:34:17.891 --> 00:34:19.226
Tell them to commit perjury?

345
00:34:19.268 --> 00:34:23.522
The prosecution can't confirm
arguments made from China.

346
00:34:23.647 --> 00:34:25.274
That's how the system works.

347
00:34:25.941 --> 00:34:28.777
If they just testify
you didn't order the killing,

348
00:34:29.152 --> 00:34:31.405
the sentence will be reduced
by 2 years.

349
00:34:32.322 --> 00:34:33.448
2 years?

350
00:34:34.032 --> 00:34:38.495
Plus, the court will consider
the rape victim's mental anguish.

351
00:34:40.539 --> 00:34:43.208
- How long have you been here?
- 9 months.

352
00:34:44.626 --> 00:34:46.044
9 months...

353
00:34:47.963 --> 00:34:49.631
Congratulations.
Only 3 months left.

354
00:34:50.132 --> 00:34:52.092
Really? Thank you!

355
00:34:52.259 --> 00:34:56.221
How can I express my gratitude?
I'll tell you later if I need help.

356
00:34:56.972 --> 00:34:59.349
Thank you, sir.

357
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.351
Thank you!

358
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.065
What's the use of
being a big shot in prison?
He's just a murderer after all.

359
00:35:15.115 --> 00:35:16.867
Attention, everyone!

360
00:35:17.618 --> 00:35:19.995
Salute the warden!

361
00:35:20.787 --> 00:35:22.164
Hello, sir!

362
00:35:23.916 --> 00:35:24.917
At ease.

363
00:35:25.417 --> 00:35:27.920
Jae-wook,
why are you working?

364
00:35:29.171 --> 00:35:30.964
It's my duty to work.

365
00:35:31.256 --> 00:35:35.177
The case you mentioned before...
how did it go?

366
00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.472
Their lawyer was left speechless.

367
00:35:39.556 --> 00:35:40.766
Good to hear.

368
00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:42.601
- Hey!
- Yes, sir.

369
00:35:44.228 --> 00:35:46.438
Thank you sir
for the papers.

370
00:35:47.356 --> 00:35:49.149
- Let's have some coffee.
- Yes, sir.

371
00:35:51.902 --> 00:35:55.030
Keep up the good work!
Yes, sir!

372
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:02.371
Nice!

373
00:36:27.104 --> 00:36:28.188
Hey, here!

374
00:36:34.987 --> 00:36:40.367
Guys.
Keep it quiet, okay?
- Yes.
- Yes, bro.

375
00:36:41.618 --> 00:36:42.703
What the hell?

376
00:36:44.663 --> 00:36:46.915
Why do people smoke that crap?

377
00:36:50.127 --> 00:36:57.342
You know what, bro?
Tell me.
Once migratory birds leave Russia,
they keep flying for 15 days

378
00:36:57.968 --> 00:37:00.470
without landing or eating.

379
00:37:01.305 --> 00:37:02.598
You know what, prosecutor?

380
00:37:03.307 --> 00:37:07.019
Once migratory birds leave Russia,
they keep flying for 15 days

381
00:37:07.186 --> 00:37:09.521
without landing or eating...

382
00:37:12.816 --> 00:37:16.695
The bird sanctuary is the place...
Those birds use that place
like a rest area.

383
00:37:16.737 --> 00:37:22.201
So they eat, drink,
take a rest.
Then they fly on
to the South Pacific.

384
00:37:25.287 --> 00:37:26.872
Where did you hear that?

385
00:37:27.998 --> 00:37:29.583
Who are you?

386
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.251
What the...

387
00:37:32.961 --> 00:37:37.508
That kind of migratory bird...
Where did you hear it?
Are you crazy?
Hey

388
00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:38.592
What is it?

389
00:37:42.387 --> 00:37:45.641
It's really important to me,
so tell me straight.

390
00:37:47.351 --> 00:37:48.852
Don’t touch, man.

391
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.271
What's wrong with him?

392
00:37:53.315 --> 00:37:55.108
Tell me now, damn it!

393
00:37:57.277 --> 00:38:05.577
Mister, I'm from the States
and we care a lot about nature.
In Pennsylvania, if you pollute,
you get the death penalty.

394
00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:07.120
You know nothing.

395
00:38:11.875 --> 00:38:13.377
I love birds!

396
00:38:14.211 --> 00:38:15.712
My favorite, right?

397
00:38:21.385 --> 00:38:22.886
Take it easy, man.

398
00:38:25.472 --> 00:38:26.849
Damn bastard...

399
00:38:32.729 --> 00:38:39.987
Even if you appeal,
you can't win.
You'd better serve your sentence.
Sign here and let's wrap this up.

400
00:38:41.238 --> 00:38:43.949
Anniversary of my father's death
is next month.

401
00:38:44.867 --> 00:38:47.244
My mother and
younger brother need me.

402
00:38:48.579 --> 00:38:51.540
I need to work
to feed my family.

403
00:38:51.748 --> 00:38:53.750
Mr. Han Chi-won,

404
00:38:54.376 --> 00:38:57.546
you lied about graduating
from Penn State!

405
00:38:57.588 --> 00:39:03.135
Sir, they were falling over
themselves trying to invest,
should I just ignore them?

406
00:39:03.427 --> 00:39:05.012
If you see cash
lying in the street,

407
00:39:05.053 --> 00:39:07.681
do you just say, 'Oh, money...'
and leave it there?

408
00:39:09.016 --> 00:39:11.894
It's true, I'm a materialist.

409
00:39:18.317 --> 00:39:21.862
- You're a public defender?
- Yes.
Which class?

410
00:39:22.446 --> 00:39:23.655
The 38th.

411
00:39:23.906 --> 00:39:27.367
Oh, you passed a bit late.
I'm from 31st class.

412
00:39:27.701 --> 00:39:32.956
Oh, it's you... sir.
Please sit.

413
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:37.211
- I'll take a look at the file.
- Pardon?
- It's a really simple case.
- What is it?

414
00:39:38.712 --> 00:39:41.131
Refer to the Supreme Court's
precedent of 1998.

415
00:39:41.507 --> 00:39:49.473
What do you think you're doing?
It sets out legal principles
for the causal relationship
between fraud and damage.

416
00:39:50.641 --> 00:39:56.271
In other words,
if there is no clear
causal relationship
between fraud and damage,

417
00:39:56.813 --> 00:39:59.399
charges of fraud
cannot be established.

418
00:40:08.242 --> 00:40:11.995
What are you doing?
What is this crazy bastard saying?

419
00:40:12.204 --> 00:40:13.330
You wait here.

420
00:40:14.873 --> 00:40:15.999
Sir...

421
00:40:42.568 --> 00:40:43.569
Sit down.

422
00:40:51.243 --> 00:40:52.578
Mr. Pennsylvania!

423
00:40:53.537 --> 00:40:57.082
So, where did you hear
the story about the birds?

424
00:40:57.583 --> 00:40:58.834
Oh, that?

425
00:40:59.334 --> 00:41:00.794
I told you already.

426
00:41:04.339 --> 00:41:05.716
Be straight with me.

427
00:41:07.301 --> 00:41:11.430
I know you've never
been on an airplane in your life

428
00:41:12.055 --> 00:41:17.102
and you've been convicted
10 times already
for swindling dumb girls.

429
00:41:17.269 --> 00:41:19.313
What the hell
are you talking about?

430
00:41:20.731 --> 00:41:25.402
9 times.
I was acquitted once last year.
If your story

431
00:41:26.486 --> 00:41:28.530
is the thing I'm looking for,

432
00:41:30.949 --> 00:41:34.995
I can get you out of here
right away.

433
00:41:46.507 --> 00:41:47.466
Just a moment.

434
00:41:51.887 --> 00:41:53.055
Okay!

435
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.058
What do you want?

436
00:41:59.228 --> 00:42:01.188
Maybe 5 years ago...?

437
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:06.735
I heard I could get paid
100 bucks per day
for studying at
some kind of service company.

438
00:42:07.402 --> 00:42:12.241
Back then I was preparing
for my own business...
so I went there to kill time.

439
00:42:12.741 --> 00:42:18.705
There were about 20 guys...
who spoke well and looked
relatively innocent for this field.

440
00:42:19.665 --> 00:42:22.209
It was nice to get paid
for learning something.

441
00:42:23.252 --> 00:42:25.671
But one day
they took us somewhere.

442
00:42:25.921 --> 00:42:30.133
They gave us iron pipes
and told us to attack the police.

443
00:42:32.427 --> 00:42:35.097
I'd never hit anyone in my life,

444
00:42:35.472 --> 00:42:36.932
so I couldn't do it.

445
00:42:39.434 --> 00:42:42.104
I never imagined
it would be that brutal.

446
00:42:43.272 --> 00:42:44.940
The person
who gave you the order

447
00:42:46.775 --> 00:42:48.485
was Jang Hyun-seok of
Far East Construction.

448
00:42:49.361 --> 00:42:50.362
Huh?

449
00:42:50.696 --> 00:42:52.155
How do you know his name?

450
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.578
Scumbags like you
are the ones I hate most.

451
00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.122
Parasites who exploit others.

452
00:43:02.749 --> 00:43:04.084
But this time,

453
00:43:05.127 --> 00:43:07.087
even if you don't want to

454
00:43:07.921 --> 00:43:10.174
I'll definitely
get you out of here.

455
00:43:24.021 --> 00:43:25.022
Listen.

456
00:43:25.564 --> 00:43:28.942
From now on, you need to
face those you fear most.

457
00:43:30.194 --> 00:43:31.278
Gangsters.

458
00:43:35.866 --> 00:43:37.701
- Come on in.
- Yes, sir.

459
00:43:39.703 --> 00:43:42.623
Prosecutors.
- Good day, chief.
- Hello.

460
00:43:47.002 --> 00:43:48.045
Politicians.

461
00:43:48.295 --> 00:43:57.721
Today I leave behind
the prosecutor's office
to which I dedicated my youth,
and start my second life
as a politician!

462
00:44:19.451 --> 00:44:21.662
Hey, copy that signature!

463
00:44:32.881 --> 00:44:34.716
Why should I copy that,
all of a sudden?

464
00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:36.969
Don't try to learn the details.

465
00:44:37.886 --> 00:44:40.222
Just practice
signing exactly the same.

466
00:44:40.389 --> 00:44:42.266
You'll need it in the future.

467
00:45:57.883 --> 00:46:00.302
They should get a dryer,
damn it.

468
00:46:00.344 --> 00:46:02.221
- Hang it there.
- Yes.

469
00:46:04.389 --> 00:46:05.557
Hi, bro.

470
00:46:06.308 --> 00:46:07.476
Easter eggs!

471
00:46:08.852 --> 00:46:10.020
I love you.

472
00:46:10.437 --> 00:46:12.648
Crazy bastard.
Give those to me.

473
00:46:12.689 --> 00:46:15.359
- Give 'em to me!
- Why?
Just give them!

474
00:46:16.944 --> 00:46:19.154
Hey, Young-cheol.
Share this with the others.

475
00:46:19.613 --> 00:46:21.532
Thank you so much, sir.

476
00:46:22.866 --> 00:46:29.706
Guys, let's have some eggs!
You're good looking
and quite smart.
Why'd you become a con-man?

477
00:46:30.332 --> 00:46:39.550
You might not know this...
I once placed 38th
nationwide in a mock SAT.
But my father passed away,
and I got all his debts.
What could I do?

478
00:46:40.092 --> 00:46:43.512
Nothing to do except to
use this face and brain.

479
00:46:45.806 --> 00:46:48.559
From my point of view,
are you a bad guy or not?

480
00:46:50.602 --> 00:46:51.603
I guess not.

481
00:46:51.854 --> 00:46:52.938
Go to hell.

482
00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.691
Once this is over,
live your life right.

483
00:46:56.316 --> 00:46:58.527
Yes, understood, bro!

484
00:47:00.362 --> 00:47:01.363
Bro?

485
00:47:10.038 --> 00:47:11.081
By the way...

486
00:47:11.331 --> 00:47:13.834
why does no one
come to see you?

487
00:47:17.462 --> 00:47:20.132
Guess I was a bad guy
on the outside.

488
00:47:21.967 --> 00:47:24.469
You must be married.
How about kids?

489
00:47:27.639 --> 00:47:28.765
You're not?

490
00:47:29.808 --> 00:47:33.645
You totally look married!
What kind of life did you lead?

491
00:47:34.396 --> 00:47:35.397
Gosh!

492
00:47:44.198 --> 00:47:45.616
Now, my verdict.

493
00:47:46.033 --> 00:47:48.202
Reflecting the Supreme
Court's precedent,

494
00:47:48.577 --> 00:47:51.038
it is hard to see
that the defendant

495
00:47:51.246 --> 00:47:56.752
showed a willingness to swindle
the victim out of money
so there is no case for fraud.

496
00:47:57.294 --> 00:48:00.255
So the court revokes
the original verdict

497
00:48:00.756 --> 00:48:03.759
and declares the defendant
not guilty.

498
00:48:10.224 --> 00:48:11.725
Congratulations, Chi-won.

499
00:48:20.108 --> 00:48:21.109
Sir!

500
00:48:22.611 --> 00:48:23.987
I'm going out tomorrow!

501
00:48:24.404 --> 00:48:25.489
Happy?

502
00:48:26.573 --> 00:48:28.367
Don't smile.
Sit!

503
00:48:37.918 --> 00:48:39.002
What's this?

504
00:48:39.127 --> 00:48:41.797
The numbers of the perjurers
at my trial 5 years ago.

505
00:48:44.508 --> 00:48:49.429
Don't waste your time
on useless crap.
Focus on the work I give you.
Hey...

506
00:48:53.308 --> 00:48:57.646
I promise that
I will do my best
to resolve your pain.

507
00:48:58.564 --> 00:49:00.440
What a fool...

508
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.068
Don't overdo it!

509
00:49:09.783 --> 00:49:12.953
Let's get back to work!
Let's get back to work!
Let's go!

510
00:49:13.871 --> 00:49:14.952
What's next?

511
00:49:15.038 --> 00:49:18.375
- Beat it, you're bugging me.
- I know you like it.

512
00:49:18.834 --> 00:49:20.836
This is why
you don't have a wife.

513
00:49:22.129 --> 00:49:23.672
I said beat it!

514
00:49:32.347 --> 00:49:33.640
Hello, who is it?

515
00:49:33.807 --> 00:49:36.727
It's me, Han Chi-won.

516
00:49:37.102 --> 00:49:38.270
Han Chi-won?

517
00:49:38.854 --> 00:49:41.481
I thought you were dead!
What brings you here?

518
00:49:43.275 --> 00:49:44.985
Take it slow.

519
00:49:45.944 --> 00:49:47.738
Do the bosses not feed you?

520
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:55.787
Guess you're on a roll.
You look so nice and shiny.
You know I use my brain.
- I can't go wrong.
- Really?

521
00:49:58.123 --> 00:50:01.293
But where are the brainy ones?

522
00:50:01.543 --> 00:50:03.504
Busy with the election campaign.

523
00:50:04.213 --> 00:50:09.426
Lots of deliveries to make.
Guys like us just get
chewed out all the time.

524
00:50:11.011 --> 00:50:15.974
Sir, I'm thankful for the meal
and happy for your success.

525
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.143
Please propose a toast.

526
00:50:18.185 --> 00:50:21.438
- Stop it.
- Please!
Give him a big hand!

527
00:50:23.357 --> 00:50:25.442
It's embarrassing.

528
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:30.322
Here, to your health
and lots of money!

529
00:50:30.781 --> 00:50:32.616
Most of all, to life!
Cheers!

530
00:50:33.575 --> 00:50:34.910
Cheers!

531
00:50:37.579 --> 00:50:38.872
He looks handsome!

532
00:50:44.461 --> 00:50:45.587
Buddy.

533
00:50:46.547 --> 00:50:48.131
Let's toast, after so long.

534
00:50:48.799 --> 00:50:49.842
Sure.

535
00:50:56.682 --> 00:50:59.059
I heard that Jin-seok died.

536
00:51:00.143 --> 00:51:02.229
I was abroad for a long time

537
00:51:02.855 --> 00:51:04.398
so couldn't attend his funeral.

538
00:51:05.858 --> 00:51:08.569
Stop it!
That was ages ago!

539
00:51:10.237 --> 00:51:14.241
- Madam! 5 more plates!
- Coming!

540
00:51:16.076 --> 00:51:22.040
And I heard that...
he was beaten to death
by this crazy prosecutor.

541
00:51:25.419 --> 00:51:26.545
Hey!

542
00:51:26.587 --> 00:51:31.133
Why do you keep talking
about the dead?
My bad.

543
00:51:31.175 --> 00:51:32.926
I'm losing my appetite.

544
00:51:40.475 --> 00:51:42.060
I'll try harder, boss.

545
00:51:44.605 --> 00:51:46.356
Let's go second round!

546
00:51:47.858 --> 00:51:49.568
Second round!

547
00:51:56.366 --> 00:52:00.245
- Look.
- Why?
Think about it.

548
00:52:01.288 --> 00:52:04.833
What on earth have you gotten
for working so hard so far?

549
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:07.920
If this greasy pork

550
00:52:08.504 --> 00:52:11.256
gives you a heart attack,
then what?

551
00:52:12.341 --> 00:52:17.095
I was an athlete
in my high school days,
and I only weighed 60 kg.

552
00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.558
But doing my job
while eating that fodder...

553
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:26.438
But at least

554
00:52:27.272 --> 00:52:31.276
we should be grateful
that we're alive like this.
So we can
drink together now!

555
00:52:32.402 --> 00:52:35.280
Look at Jin-seok.
What kind of life is that?

556
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:39.826
Damn poor bastard.

557
00:52:41.703 --> 00:52:44.373
He could never
even breathe properly.

558
00:52:45.582 --> 00:52:47.292
We always teased him.

559
00:52:49.127 --> 00:52:53.006
Then... was he sick
in the first place?

560
00:52:53.215 --> 00:52:56.468
You didn't know?
His asthma was really serious!

561
00:52:57.803 --> 00:52:59.763
What? Asthma?

562
00:53:03.141 --> 00:53:05.185
You knew he had asthma?

563
00:53:05.519 --> 00:53:09.565
Sure.
Everyone knew about it.
Why do you ask?

564
00:53:09.982 --> 00:53:11.233
You didn't know?

565
00:53:11.275 --> 00:53:12.818
I didn't.

566
00:53:15.237 --> 00:53:17.406
How could he...

567
00:53:23.745 --> 00:53:24.788
My friend.

568
00:53:25.664 --> 00:53:26.790
Let's drink.

569
00:53:46.518 --> 00:53:48.270
Can I have one?

570
00:53:50.397 --> 00:53:51.398
Thank you.

571
00:54:22.763 --> 00:54:24.014
What I mean is...

572
00:54:24.389 --> 00:54:26.975
if Jin-seok started to talk the crap

573
00:54:27.935 --> 00:54:30.395
it could've ruined
the boss' business.

574
00:54:32.064 --> 00:54:35.526
Right.
That's what I mean!

575
00:54:37.027 --> 00:54:39.863
- So the boss did it to him?
- Right.

576
00:54:41.532 --> 00:54:45.282
The boss ordered Jin-seok killed.

577
00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:53.919
So you're saying it's not
the prosecutor who did it.
Right?
I got it all right.

578
00:55:03.136 --> 00:55:06.515
That's why I lied in court.

579
00:55:09.226 --> 00:55:12.020
We just did as the boss ordered.
Damn that's hot!

580
00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:16.233
Oh! Are you okay?
Are you crazy?
You bastard!

581
00:55:24.199 --> 00:55:26.577
It turned out really nice!

582
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:28.537
Son of Pohang...

583
00:55:28.996 --> 00:55:31.874
To be precise,
I'm not from Pohang.

584
00:55:32.249 --> 00:55:38.922
Don't say that again!
For a politician,
your precinct is your hometown.
Yes, sir.

585
00:55:44.511 --> 00:55:47.264
Oh, Jang. Make it quick.
I'm a bit busy now.

586
00:55:47.514 --> 00:55:51.226
Sir, have you heard?
Heard what?

587
00:55:52.102 --> 00:55:54.354
Byun Jae-wook applied for a retrial.

588
00:55:54.813 --> 00:56:00.319
I think one of my boys
might've said something...
I'm afraid
something could go wrong.

589
00:56:00.652 --> 00:56:02.779
Don't talk about this
on the phone.

590
00:56:04.448 --> 00:56:08.452
Where are you now?
Are you out of your minds,
you bloody bastards?

591
00:56:08.994 --> 00:56:11.914
How long do I have to do this?

592
00:56:12.581 --> 00:56:13.790
You damn bastards!

593
00:56:20.839 --> 00:56:22.090
You guys wait outside.

594
00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:36.939
- Sir.
- Mr. Jang.

595
00:56:38.357 --> 00:56:41.443
Since becoming a prosecutor,
I developed a daily routine.

596
00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:44.404
- You know what it is?
- Pardon?

597
00:56:45.864 --> 00:56:46.990
Don't know sir.

598
00:56:47.282 --> 00:56:49.743
I meditate for an hour
every morning.

599
00:56:50.661 --> 00:56:53.872
Doing that clears my head

600
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:59.670
and I can see clearly
what I couldn't before.
You see what?

601
00:57:00.796 --> 00:57:03.799
I can see, among those
who beg under my feet,

602
00:57:04.925 --> 00:57:07.636
who will backstab me someday.

603
00:57:09.596 --> 00:57:10.639
I'm sorry, sir.

604
00:57:11.849 --> 00:57:13.183
Look at you...

605
00:57:13.559 --> 00:57:18.689
I turned a reckless moron
into a businessman!

606
00:57:19.398 --> 00:57:22.442
And you pay me back
with this kind of a mess?

607
00:57:25.028 --> 00:57:26.029
Sir!

608
00:57:27.155 --> 00:57:28.949
I understand
you are not satisfied

609
00:57:29.616 --> 00:57:31.451
but I tried my best for you...

610
00:57:49.178 --> 00:57:50.971
Only a month until the election.

611
00:57:52.389 --> 00:57:53.724
Let's get it right.

612
00:57:58.103 --> 00:57:59.438
And call me often!

613
00:58:13.327 --> 00:58:14.328
Yes, sir.

614
00:58:15.537 --> 00:58:19.166
We've got the slippery one.
Okay. Good job.

615
00:58:20.125 --> 00:58:21.585
You wrap it up on your own.

616
00:58:21.627 --> 00:58:23.837
What do you mean
by wrapping it up?

617
00:58:24.463 --> 00:58:33.388
You stupid brat.
Whether you scare him
into silence,
or beat him senseless,
I don't care.
I just want you to handle it

618
00:58:34.139 --> 00:58:35.849
and report me the result!

619
00:58:36.725 --> 00:58:38.852
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

620
00:58:49.613 --> 00:58:53.450
- Hello, sir!
- Long time no see, Min-woo!

621
00:58:54.409 --> 00:59:00.999
You've been on the
up and up nowadays!
You look a bit exhausted.
Don't enter politics.

622
00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:04.378
It's quite tough.

623
00:59:07.548 --> 00:59:09.842
Did something happen?

624
00:59:12.886 --> 00:59:14.888
Well... I heard

625
00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:17.474
Byun Jae-wook appealed.

626
00:59:17.891 --> 00:59:19.017
Pardon?

627
00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:23.730
I'm afraid it might stir up gossip
right before the election.

628
00:59:23.856 --> 00:59:29.903
Why so suddenly?
This is perfect timing
to put a dent in my career.

629
00:59:31.154 --> 00:59:34.700
It's been a while
since you met your friend.

630
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:37.244
You go and meet him.

631
00:59:38.912 --> 00:59:41.707
The trial can wait...

632
00:59:43.041 --> 00:59:44.626
until the election is over.

633
00:59:51.008 --> 00:59:55.220
Wow, you've changed a lot!
You grew a beard?

634
00:59:57.598 --> 01:00:01.185
Let us talk in private.

635
01:00:03.061 --> 01:00:08.650
And I assume it's okay to smoke?
Well, yes, sir.

636
01:00:17.576 --> 01:00:18.577
Have one.

637
01:00:19.077 --> 01:00:21.496
It's hard to get
one of these here.

638
01:00:30.088 --> 01:00:32.216
I don't know
what's on your mind.

639
01:00:32.466 --> 01:00:36.345
But if you are trying to
raise hay to sabotage us,
I warn you to stop.

640
01:00:40.474 --> 01:00:42.434
You came all the way
to tell me this?

641
01:00:42.643 --> 01:00:45.687
You know well
there'll be no retrial

642
01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:47.648
with one piece of evidence.

643
01:00:49.608 --> 01:00:51.193
Wow...

644
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:54.571
Now you talk like a prosecutor.

645
01:00:55.322 --> 01:00:57.115
Finally learned
how to threaten.

646
01:00:57.366 --> 01:01:04.873
Don't be sarcastic.
For 20 years since high school
I smoked 3 packs a day.
But I quit five years ago.

647
01:01:05.332 --> 01:01:08.669
My head's never been clearer
in my whole life.

648
01:01:10.671 --> 01:01:12.339
Take care.

649
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.387
Give Woo my best regards.

650
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.311
Ruthless bastards...

651
01:01:45.497 --> 01:01:46.832
I'm sorry, pal.

652
01:01:49.376 --> 01:01:54.006
Did you convince him to testify?
He's all smashed up.

653
01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:56.842
He might live the rest of
his life half-paralyzed.

654
01:01:58.343 --> 01:01:59.011
Damn...you're okay?

655
01:01:59.052 --> 01:02:08.979
Wouldn't be talking to you
if I were caught.
Might be drowned or in pieces
at the bottom of some lake.
Let's talk more face to face.
Come meet me.

656
01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:13.609
Sir.
I gave it a lot of thought.

657
01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:17.529
I think I paid you back
for what you've done for me.

658
01:02:18.322 --> 01:02:20.157
Please don't call anymore.

659
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:39.259
Hanna told me
you two would like to run
a small business.

660
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:43.847
Isn't it too humble for you
after all your studies
in the States?

661
01:02:44.556 --> 01:02:47.392
We can start small first.

662
01:02:47.976 --> 01:02:49.853
My folks also started

663
01:02:49.895 --> 01:02:52.481
with a small gas station
in the US.

664
01:02:54.733 --> 01:02:57.611
You went to Penn, right?
Yes!

665
01:02:58.278 --> 01:03:01.406
I studied business administration.
Did you?

666
01:03:01.782 --> 01:03:05.118
They don't have that department.

667
01:03:08.372 --> 01:03:09.623
I mean the graduate school.

668
01:03:09.831 --> 01:03:12.125
Ah, you went to Wharton?

669
01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:16.922
One of my friends
studied there, too.
Is that so?

670
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:19.633
Are you talking about Kyung-min?

671
01:03:20.133 --> 01:03:21.635
That's right.

672
01:03:21.844 --> 01:03:24.429
He's your age,
he must've studied with you.

673
01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:27.804
You must know each other.
Not many Koreans at that school.

674
01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:32.104
Right, Kyung-min...
The tall thin guy
who's good at basketball.

675
01:03:32.896 --> 01:03:35.107
He's not even 170cm.

676
01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:43.323
Sorry, I confused him
with another friend.
Let me see... Kyung-min...

677
01:03:46.368 --> 01:03:49.329
Honey, my brother told me

678
01:03:49.454 --> 01:03:52.165
you talk like a person
from Gyeongsang Province.

679
01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:55.335
Gyeongsang Province?

680
01:03:59.506 --> 01:04:01.925
Is it near Busan?

681
01:04:04.094 --> 01:04:12.978
I don't really know
but some say a Penn accent
sounds quite similar
to Gyeongsang dialect.
Does it?

682
01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:15.606
But I should have
a chat with him.

683
01:04:16.523 --> 01:04:19.484
Calling an American
a Gyeongsang hillbilly.

684
01:04:30.746 --> 01:04:32.206
Why isn't it moving?

685
01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.921
Hello?

686
01:04:39.588 --> 01:04:40.589
Excuse me?

687
01:04:47.596 --> 01:04:48.680
Excuse me.

688
01:04:53.227 --> 01:04:54.478
Why are you doing this?

689
01:04:55.521 --> 01:04:56.522
I'm sorry.

690
01:04:58.524 --> 01:04:59.983
No...not my face!

691
01:05:01.735 --> 01:05:02.736
What is it?

692
01:05:03.278 --> 01:05:04.363
Oh my god.

693
01:05:05.906 --> 01:05:07.282
What are you guys?

694
01:05:07.282 --> 01:05:12.704
- Hey!
- It's alright.
Who are you anyway?
Hands off me!
Are you crazy?

695
01:05:18.043 --> 01:05:19.294
Listen, Han Chi-won.

696
01:05:20.462 --> 01:05:24.383
Shall I tell your chick
you're a high school drop-out
with nine convictions?

697
01:05:27.386 --> 01:05:29.805
You still need to pay him back.

698
01:06:00.544 --> 01:06:02.713
You said you won't see me.
What brings you here?

699
01:06:03.547 --> 01:06:05.090
Hey.

700
01:06:06.133 --> 01:06:10.012
See what you've done
to a class A masterpiece?

701
01:06:10.554 --> 01:06:12.347
Why are you doing this to me?

702
01:06:16.435 --> 01:06:18.395
Even if you leave me,

703
01:06:19.771 --> 01:06:22.024
Woo will kill you anyway.

704
01:06:25.569 --> 01:06:29.114
Are you crazy or what?

705
01:06:31.158 --> 01:06:34.036
You think I'm so weak?

706
01:06:35.913 --> 01:06:39.416
If you want to live rest of your life
on the run, suit yourself.

707
01:06:42.628 --> 01:06:44.213
Sir! Hello!

708
01:06:46.006 --> 01:06:47.382
Wait a sec!

709
01:06:56.934 --> 01:06:59.353
So what do you want me to do?

710
01:07:01.146 --> 01:07:04.691
Tell me.
You have no other option either.

711
01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:10.155
Can I trust you?

712
01:07:11.823 --> 01:07:18.163
It's just too hard.
It's killing me.
I want to get it done ASAP

713
01:07:19.331 --> 01:07:25.629
and return home to grow
some garlic with my old man.
Didn't you say you lost
your father in junior high?

714
01:07:33.595 --> 01:07:40.056
Did I?
I have dedicated 25 years
of my life to the law!

715
01:07:40.602 --> 01:07:47.276
Now, I will devote myself
solely to my hometown, Pohang!

716
01:07:50.904 --> 01:07:55.284
As the returned son
of Pohang,

717
01:07:55.450 --> 01:08:00.914
please accept a big bow
from me,
to the respected citizens
of my dear city!

718
01:08:06.253 --> 01:08:09.131
Woo Jong-Gil! Woo Jong-Gil!

719
01:08:09.339 --> 01:08:12.176
Woo Jong-Gil for Congress!

720
01:08:13.177 --> 01:08:15.387
Please give us some music!

721
01:08:18.182 --> 01:08:21.768
Please remember,
Candidate No.1 Woo Jong-Gil.

722
01:08:22.227 --> 01:08:27.316
Dear citizens of Pohang!
Give a hand to Woo Jong-Gil.

723
01:08:28.483 --> 01:08:32.070
And let us offer you

724
01:08:32.362 --> 01:08:37.451
some campaign fun!
Make some noise, please!

725
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:42.998
Your energy must've
pumped him up hard.

726
01:08:43.415 --> 01:08:45.709
Look at his moves!

727
01:08:48.879 --> 01:08:50.464
He sure can dance!

728
01:08:50.881 --> 01:08:53.509
Look at her,
she feels the rhythm, too.

729
01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:57.513
Let's enjoy it together!
Ho ho ho!

730
01:09:10.442 --> 01:09:14.821
Wow.
Good job, ma'am.
Thank you
for the hard work.

731
01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:17.866
Look who's here.

732
01:09:18.742 --> 01:09:24.331
This young man knows
how to cheer up a crowd.
I will do my best for you!
Thank you.

733
01:09:24.706 --> 01:09:29.753
Would you mind if
I take a picture with you?
- Not at all, go ahead!
- Thank you, sir!

734
01:09:37.177 --> 01:09:39.471
It's an honor, sir!
Thank you everyone!

735
01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:43.851
Woo Jong-Gil for Congress!
Way to go!
Woo Jong-Gil!
Woo Jong-Gil!

736
01:09:45.811 --> 01:09:48.814
Such a pretty young man.

737
01:09:49.273 --> 01:09:50.524
Are you a student?

738
01:09:50.858 --> 01:10:01.785
Yes, just finished
military service.
I'm trying out things
before going back to school.
What other things do you do?
I tutor a few students.
You must be
really good at studying!

739
01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:03.996
What university?

740
01:10:05.205 --> 01:10:09.293
In Seoul...begins with an S...

741
01:10:09.626 --> 01:10:18.802
Holy cow! You're too good
for this kind of thing.
Such an outstanding talent!
Your mom must be proud of you.
I envy her.

742
01:10:18.927 --> 01:10:21.138
I wish I had a son like you.

743
01:10:21.513 --> 01:10:25.017
Wait!
How do you fancy Yuna?

744
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:30.522
I guess you two could
make a good couple.

745
01:10:31.273 --> 01:10:34.610
He's studying at
Seoul University!
Stop it, ma'am.

746
01:10:36.153 --> 01:10:40.282
I have a boyfriend...
Though he's in the army.

747
01:10:45.454 --> 01:10:47.372
- Thank you all.
- Good night, sir.

748
01:10:47.539 --> 01:10:48.540
See you tomorrow.

749
01:10:48.665 --> 01:10:49.750
Thank you.

750
01:11:01.637 --> 01:11:04.681
No, not here...
It's okay, don't worry.

751
01:12:11.164 --> 01:12:14.126
Appeal to dismiss charges
against an ex-prosecutor

752
01:12:14.626 --> 01:12:16.170
serving time for homicide.

753
01:12:17.713 --> 01:12:22.509
This is big.
Raising a fuss 5 years later
for a case he can't win,

754
01:12:23.177 --> 01:12:27.097
it's for manipulating
the media, your honor.
Listen, Byun Jae-wook.

755
01:12:27.806 --> 01:12:29.808
Are you just doing this
to cause trouble?

756
01:12:29.808 --> 01:12:34.104
Didn't you hear the recorded file
submitted as evidence?

757
01:12:35.564 --> 01:12:37.024
Please approve a retrial.

758
01:12:37.691 --> 01:12:39.151
What I mean is...

759
01:12:39.735 --> 01:12:44.948
why is it now that
you're bringing this up?
What were you doing back then?

760
01:12:45.407 --> 01:12:50.204
The night before the trial...
someone offered me probation.

761
01:12:51.371 --> 01:12:55.125
That's why I pleaded guilty
giving false testimony.

762
01:12:56.502 --> 01:12:57.961
Who did that?

763
01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:01.715
- Woo Jong-Gil.
- What?

764
01:13:04.635 --> 01:13:06.678
What did you just say?

765
01:13:08.972 --> 01:13:11.266
Please approve a retrial, sir.

766
01:13:12.267 --> 01:13:14.895
I will reveal everything
in court.

767
01:13:25.739 --> 01:13:26.823
How did it go?

768
01:13:27.574 --> 01:13:28.742
The retrial...

769
01:13:29.326 --> 01:13:30.786
was approved.

770
01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:35.082
That was the best you could do?

771
01:13:35.958 --> 01:13:37.000
I am sorry, sir.

772
01:13:37.459 --> 01:13:40.712
No, it's not your fault.

773
01:13:42.464 --> 01:13:43.757
And sir...

774
01:13:45.259 --> 01:13:48.011
Byun requested you as a witness.

775
01:13:51.139 --> 01:13:52.432
Jae-wook...

776
01:13:53.642 --> 01:13:55.769
he must hate me a lot.

777
01:14:00.023 --> 01:14:02.192
By the way, sir...

778
01:14:02.985 --> 01:14:07.698
Is there anything between you
and Jae-wook that I don't know?

779
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:13.287
What do you mean?
What can there be?

780
01:14:14.454 --> 01:14:16.582
It's just mean political maneuvering.

781
01:14:17.833 --> 01:14:21.753
You just make sure
I won't have to appear in court.

782
01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:24.756
You can go now.

783
01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.311
Such a moron...

784
01:14:45.903 --> 01:14:47.696
Warden Kim! How are you?

785
01:14:49.615 --> 01:14:51.158
Just letting you know...

786
01:14:51.825 --> 01:14:54.995
The Ministry of Justice will
inspect your facility next week.

787
01:14:58.081 --> 01:15:00.334
I thought I should
notify you.

788
01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.177
Stand by for inspection!

789
01:15:17.768 --> 01:15:18.769
Move away.

790
01:15:21.772 --> 01:15:24.650
- That is nothing.
- Hands off!
- Sir, please don't.
- Come out, bastard!

791
01:15:24.691 --> 01:15:25.984
- Sir, please!
- I said get out!

792
01:15:26.944 --> 01:15:31.198
No. 3820! Detention of 30 days
for keeping restricted items!

793
01:15:31.573 --> 01:15:36.328
Transfer? Why all of a sudden?
Officer, please tell me!

794
01:15:39.706 --> 01:15:43.794
Sir, they say
I'll be transferred!
Sir, please do something!

795
01:15:44.211 --> 01:15:46.964
Sir! Sir!
Look ahead!

796
01:15:59.309 --> 01:16:08.735
Despite recent allegations
of slush funds
Candidate Woo Jong-Gil
of the Creative People's Party
is leading by 7%
in the latest poll.

797
01:16:10.821 --> 01:16:11.822
It's me.

798
01:16:12.739 --> 01:16:14.074
Listen carefully.

799
01:16:14.491 --> 01:16:16.326
Things are not good in here.

800
01:16:17.202 --> 01:16:18.954
I won't be able to call you.

801
01:16:19.997 --> 01:16:22.332
We should talk.
Come in right now.

802
01:16:27.588 --> 01:16:30.632
Hey, No. 3820!
What are you doing there?

803
01:16:30.924 --> 01:16:32.885
Nothing, officer.
Just finishing up.

804
01:16:33.093 --> 01:16:34.386
Hurry!

805
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:35.971
Go in.

806
01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:46.899
The money is ready.

807
01:16:48.483 --> 01:16:50.611
This will be our last meeting.

808
01:16:51.987 --> 01:16:54.698
Woo is making his moves.

809
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:56.950
You'll be on your own
from now on.

810
01:16:57.993 --> 01:17:01.830
Let me get this straight.
Has anyone ever helped me?

811
01:17:02.998 --> 01:17:04.208
Everything...

812
01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:06.793
is up to you now.

813
01:17:08.837 --> 01:17:10.506
Let's pray for one last time.

814
01:17:21.683 --> 01:17:25.938
Come to me, all you who are
weary and burdened

815
01:17:26.104 --> 01:17:28.190
and I will give you rest.

816
01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:31.026
Amen.
Amen.

817
01:17:40.536 --> 01:17:47.251
"...give you rest."
The real game is on now.
So better not mess it up.
Don't waste your time on girls.

818
01:17:47.501 --> 01:17:49.044
Press your pin, sir.

819
01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:54.633
Matthew
11:28

820
01:18:18.407 --> 01:18:20.534
How much more do you need?

821
01:18:21.285 --> 01:18:27.958
Didn't we pick Canada
because the tuition's cheaper?
Kang was deserted by Woo
and has no one to rely on.

822
01:18:28.208 --> 01:18:33.714
His only crime was
to conceal evidence
and the statute of limitations
has expired.

823
01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:37.092
You can definitely get him
with that money.

824
01:18:43.098 --> 01:18:44.099
Who is it?

825
01:18:44.433 --> 01:18:46.059
Chief Kang, is it?

826
01:18:49.771 --> 01:18:50.772
Hello.

827
01:18:51.148 --> 01:18:52.191
Who are you?

828
01:19:06.079 --> 01:19:09.166
Chief Prosecutor
Yang Min-woo
Seoul District
Public Prosecutors' Office.

829
01:19:09.333 --> 01:19:17.591
He is really distrustful,
not easy to approach.
But he is very conscious of others.
so start from the hot shots near him.

830
01:19:21.345 --> 01:19:27.100
Kim Chang-seop,
Director of Inspection
at Supreme Prosecutors' Office.
He likes people and booze.

831
01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:29.686
And he's quite careless.

832
01:19:30.103 --> 01:19:35.609
He'll be the perfect target
to start with.
Sir, it was great seeing you
the other time.

833
01:19:36.944 --> 01:19:41.782
Have we met before?
Stop joking, sir.
You'll hurt my feelings.

834
01:19:42.324 --> 01:19:45.661
I'm sorry.
Was it at a seminar?

835
01:19:45.994 --> 01:19:47.538
- Yes!
- Now I remember.

836
01:19:47.579 --> 01:19:51.959
Jeonju District Court head
Park Chung-jik.
He's married to Hyesung Corp.

837
01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.628
Hates people from Daegu.

838
01:19:55.879 --> 01:20:00.217
Then he kept giving me
all this Daegu something...
So I made it very clear

839
01:20:01.051 --> 01:20:03.595
that Daegu people
are naturally greedy

840
01:20:04.179 --> 01:20:06.682
and that's the source of
our country's problems.

841
01:20:07.975 --> 01:20:09.685
You have sharp insight.

842
01:20:11.645 --> 01:20:13.772
I like him better and better.

843
01:20:13.897 --> 01:20:15.274
- Thank you, sir.
- Let's toast.

844
01:20:19.653 --> 01:20:26.702
I have a Chateau Margeaux,
present from a client.
It'd feel less like a bribe
if we share it together.

845
01:20:40.007 --> 01:20:43.385
If you reach that far,
Min-woo will take the bait.

846
01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:46.597
He can't stand being left out
from the bunch.

847
01:20:46.722 --> 01:20:49.641
Min-woo wants to be a star,
not a prosecutor.

848
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.853
Hey, Yang. Come here.

849
01:21:01.278 --> 01:21:03.322
Should I call you
Chief Prosecutor?

850
01:21:03.614 --> 01:21:07.075
No, I don't deserve
the title quite yet, sir.

851
01:21:08.327 --> 01:21:12.372
I just carry the responsibility.
You are too humble.

852
01:21:12.956 --> 01:21:17.336
This is prosecutor Kim Jae-young
from the south branch office.

853
01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:23.091
A very smart young man.
I'm just humbly following
in the footsteps

854
01:21:23.133 --> 01:21:25.219
of great figures like you.

855
01:21:26.303 --> 01:21:28.180
Listen to this guy talk!

856
01:21:29.097 --> 01:21:32.893
How come I didn't
met you sooner?
Thank you, sir.

857
01:21:33.185 --> 01:21:34.645
Introduce yourselves.

858
01:21:35.479 --> 01:21:37.314
How do you do, sir.

859
01:21:38.273 --> 01:21:40.651
Kim Jae-young.
It's an honor to meet you.

860
01:21:41.568 --> 01:21:43.403
Yeah... good to see you.

861
01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:49.159
Sir, can I call on your office
sometime soon?

862
01:21:50.118 --> 01:21:51.119
What?

863
01:21:51.828 --> 01:21:52.908
Why?

864
01:21:53.038 --> 01:21:55.666
It's important,
so I'd rather talk in private.

865
01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.715
I'm from Hwimoon High,
class of 95.

866
01:22:04.216 --> 01:22:13.016
- Really?
- Yes.
- We're high school alumni, too.
- At your service, sir.
Great, let's keep in touch.

867
01:22:14.309 --> 01:22:16.103
Who was your
homeroom teacher?

868
01:22:17.437 --> 01:22:18.438
The... Snake!

869
01:22:18.814 --> 01:22:22.276
What? Is he still...?
- Of course!
- Amazing.

870
01:23:06.737 --> 01:23:08.030
Can I help you?

871
01:23:09.156 --> 01:23:11.366
No, it's okay.
What's wrong with this?

872
01:23:17.998 --> 01:23:21.793
Excuse me.
Prosecutor Kim Jae-young?

873
01:23:22.628 --> 01:23:23.337
Yes, I am.

874
01:23:23.587 --> 01:23:26.882
How are you, sir?
I'm Park from
Prosecutor Yang's office.

875
01:23:29.218 --> 01:23:33.764
- Great to meet you.
- Pleasure.
Believe us, counsel,
we didn't pocket the book.

876
01:23:34.473 --> 01:23:41.016
That college bastard did,
tempting our clerk here.
- Really?
- Tell him, Yuna.

877
01:23:42.689 --> 01:23:44.233
What are you doing?

878
01:23:51.281 --> 01:23:52.324
Sir?

879
01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.160
Good morning, sir.

880
01:23:55.452 --> 01:23:57.996
Welcome!
Take a seat.

881
01:23:59.331 --> 01:24:02.709
I found this while
investigating Jang Hyun-seok.

882
01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:07.089
Seems like his money is
flowing to politicians.

883
01:24:09.842 --> 01:24:13.929
Are you talking about
Woo's slush fund?
That case is almost wrapped up.

884
01:24:14.304 --> 01:24:18.225
That slush fund file
is just the tip of the iceberg.

885
01:24:19.476 --> 01:24:22.813
I looked into the development
of the migrant birds' sanctuary.

886
01:24:23.146 --> 01:24:26.608
It serves as a gold digging scam
for political big shots.

887
01:24:26.859 --> 01:24:30.654
Why are you showing this to me?

888
01:24:31.697 --> 01:24:35.868
I heard...
you're quite close
to Candidate Woo.

889
01:24:37.578 --> 01:24:39.037
Just get to the point.

890
01:24:39.413 --> 01:24:41.957
If this were leaked
to the media,

891
01:24:42.374 --> 01:24:45.252
it might hurt you too,
so I wanted to let you know.

892
01:24:46.086 --> 01:24:50.465
Jang and Woo...
are also relevant
to the Byun Jae-wook case.

893
01:24:52.551 --> 01:24:53.719
I want...

894
01:24:56.221 --> 01:24:58.348
...to be on your side.

895
01:25:00.225 --> 01:25:04.646
Didn't know you were
such a daredevil!

896
01:25:04.813 --> 01:25:05.981
I like it!

897
01:25:12.529 --> 01:25:16.450
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
- But you need to sign this.
- Sure, of course.

898
01:25:28.086 --> 01:25:32.758
And you have a morning meeting.
Right, I almost forgot.

899
01:25:34.051 --> 01:25:36.512
I'll go to this meeting,
but let's talk afterwards.

900
01:25:39.556 --> 01:25:42.434
No, stay here.
I won't be long.

901
01:25:42.768 --> 01:25:43.936
Yes, sir!

902
01:25:44.645 --> 01:25:46.813
What a cheerful fella.

903
01:25:47.773 --> 01:25:49.816
I love you, sir!

904
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:44.371
Where'd he go?

905
01:26:44.746 --> 01:26:46.748
He said he'd go
to the restroom.

906
01:26:47.624 --> 01:26:51.461
And I sent the document
to Judge Choi's office, sir.

907
01:26:52.754 --> 01:26:54.840
What document?
It's...

908
01:26:56.258 --> 01:27:00.762
the summons for witness...
He told me
you said to send it over.

909
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:02.514
Did I?

910
01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.058
What are you talking about?

911
01:27:08.729 --> 01:27:09.897
What's this about?

912
01:27:24.828 --> 01:27:27.122
Yes, boss.
Looks like him.

913
01:27:37.341 --> 01:27:48.602
No, I won't go!
Get out now!
Do what I tell you!
I said I'm alright.
What's wrong with you?
Chi-won! Honey!
Come here.
Bro, what is it?
Please calm down.
You lowlife!

914
01:27:49.061 --> 01:27:53.607
I should've guessed it
from your lousy English.
- Hey!
- Don't!

915
01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:59.571
How dare you swindle
my innocent little sister?
Screw Pennsylvania!

916
01:28:00.155 --> 01:28:01.740
Speak some English.

917
01:28:02.658 --> 01:28:08.205
Cat got your tongue?
What's wrong with you?
I said I'm fine with it!
Are you crazy?

918
01:28:10.582 --> 01:28:16.213
If you don't come now
I'll have him thrown in jail!
You're disgracing the entire family!

919
01:28:16.588 --> 01:28:24.304
- Let's go!
- I won't!
Get out!
I love you, Chi-won!
- What? Love him?
- Leave me alone!

920
01:28:25.055 --> 01:28:30.310
I don't want to go!
Open that door, Missy.
- I don't want to go!
- Come right now!

921
01:28:45.284 --> 01:28:46.285
Open the door!

922
01:28:50.956 --> 01:28:52.332
Such a sissy...

923
01:28:56.712 --> 01:28:58.839
Where is that bastard?

924
01:29:03.552 --> 01:29:07.472
- Hey!
- What?
Where are you going?
To check upstairs.

925
01:29:07.764 --> 01:29:09.725
Our guys are already on it.

926
01:29:10.726 --> 01:29:12.102
Then downstairs.

927
01:29:13.061 --> 01:29:14.062
Alright then.

928
01:29:14.813 --> 01:29:18.442
That bastard Han Chi-won,
he's dead meat!

929
01:29:37.628 --> 01:29:39.379
Long time no see, beanpole.

930
01:29:46.803 --> 01:29:50.557
- Is business alright?
- Ah, yes.
- Thank you for your support.
- Yes, yes.

931
01:29:50.599 --> 01:29:56.438
I will do my best!
Sir.
- What?
- A call from the High Court.

932
01:29:57.981 --> 01:30:01.235
You're summoned as a witness.
10 am Wednesday.

933
01:30:03.737 --> 01:30:05.197
I see.

934
01:30:06.573 --> 01:30:10.452
Hey, Judge Choi.
What do you think you're doing?
You think you can do this to me?

935
01:30:11.703 --> 01:30:13.956
What do you mean?
You have the final call on this!

936
01:30:14.289 --> 01:30:16.667
What is it?
Open the door, you idiot!

937
01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:18.502
Don't you know who I am?

938
01:30:28.971 --> 01:30:30.305
Why did you sign it?

939
01:30:32.057 --> 01:30:34.351
Do you realize
what you did to me?

940
01:30:35.519 --> 01:30:36.728
I didn't do it.

941
01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:38.522
You stupid idiot.

942
01:30:39.273 --> 01:30:42.276
I received this
because you signed it!

943
01:30:47.489 --> 01:30:49.700
Stop it, will you?
What?

944
01:30:51.827 --> 01:30:53.620
What did you just say?

945
01:30:55.038 --> 01:30:56.164
Say it again.

946
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:58.750
You think I'm blind?

947
01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:03.422
I did some research and
this is not your only problem.

948
01:31:06.383 --> 01:31:08.844
So you're saying,
let's go our separate ways?

949
01:31:11.805 --> 01:31:13.515
I'll see you in court.

950
01:31:14.266 --> 01:31:16.059
Okay, see you there.

951
01:31:17.811 --> 01:31:22.024
People never know
when their downfall starts.

952
01:31:40.125 --> 01:31:41.126
Chief Park!

953
01:31:43.253 --> 01:31:48.759
Arrest Jang Hyun-seok
of Far East Construction now!
Excuse me?
On what charges?

954
01:31:48.884 --> 01:31:51.762
Why do you have to know?

955
01:31:52.221 --> 01:31:58.393
I'll do whatever I need to
to get the warrant.
So just drag him in, got it?

956
01:31:59.061 --> 01:32:00.938
Yes, sir.

957
01:32:06.443 --> 01:32:07.444
Please boss!

958
01:32:11.448 --> 01:32:14.910
Forgive me this once.
You slippery little bastard.

959
01:32:14.952 --> 01:32:18.372
You caused so much trouble
for so many higher-ups.

960
01:32:18.747 --> 01:32:26.171
You know that?
I must've been out of my mind.
If you forgive me once,
I'll do anything you say...
Beat him!
Boss, please!

961
01:32:26.588 --> 01:32:27.506
Boss!
Boss!

962
01:32:27.589 --> 01:32:28.590
Don't move!

963
01:32:30.926 --> 01:32:34.346
What's that?
Please don't do it, guys!

964
01:32:37.641 --> 01:32:39.268
Hold him tight.

965
01:32:39.393 --> 01:32:41.186
Please, don't kill me!

966
01:32:54.324 --> 01:32:57.703
Arrest them all!
Goddamn it!
Run!

967
01:33:03.792 --> 01:33:04.877
You little...

968
01:33:25.439 --> 01:33:28.400
Damn bastards!
Let go of me, dammit!

969
01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:31.695
- Damn, that hurts!
- Don't move.

970
01:33:38.785 --> 01:33:39.786
What is it?

971
01:33:43.624 --> 01:33:44.791
Prosecutor?

972
01:33:46.418 --> 01:33:49.004
Are you Prosecutor Kim Jae-young?

973
01:33:50.255 --> 01:33:51.340
Who...are you?

974
01:33:51.965 --> 01:33:56.595
Don't you remember me?
I'm Park from
Prosecutor Yang's office.

975
01:33:57.054 --> 01:34:00.474
- Ah, Chief Park.
- Yes!

976
01:34:02.851 --> 01:34:06.313
Did those bastards hurt you?
It's okay, I'm fine.
Are you alright, sir?

977
01:34:07.105 --> 01:34:09.483
- You should've come sooner.
- I'm sorry, sir.

978
01:34:10.192 --> 01:34:13.403
Those pricks...
Useless bastards...

979
01:34:14.738 --> 01:34:17.115
What am I being arrested for?

980
01:34:17.533 --> 01:34:21.078
You should at least
tell me the charges!
Don't push me!

981
01:34:21.203 --> 01:34:23.038
You crazy bastard!

982
01:34:24.915 --> 01:34:30.379
How dare you terrorize
a prosecutor of Korea?
Stop it, bastard!

983
01:34:30.504 --> 01:34:39.805
- You call me a bastard?
- Please calm down, sir.
You know who I am?
You little...
Come here, I'll kill you!

984
01:34:39.888 --> 01:34:40.931
Take him right now!

985
01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:43.809
That stupid moron...

986
01:34:44.810 --> 01:34:53.360
Yes, I got them all.
You deserve to rot behind bars.
Pardon?
I will kill you!
- You stupid thugs...
- Yes, sir.

987
01:35:01.785 --> 01:35:05.914
Fraud, forging diplomas,
pyramid schemes, identity theft...

988
01:35:06.498 --> 01:35:09.459
Ten criminal convictions
at the age of 32.

989
01:35:10.210 --> 01:35:12.796
You're the most crooked
crook of all.

990
01:35:12.963 --> 01:35:16.717
It's all I could do to survive.

991
01:35:18.635 --> 01:35:21.388
I still can't believe it.

992
01:35:22.139 --> 01:35:24.224
How dare you
impersonate a prosecutor?

993
01:35:25.058 --> 01:35:26.560
You're not from Hwimoon High?

994
01:35:30.856 --> 01:35:31.857
Sorry.

995
01:35:32.608 --> 01:35:39.031
I can see you like
fooling people.
Let's see if you keep laughing
back in prison.

996
01:35:42.534 --> 01:35:43.535
Sir.

997
01:35:44.286 --> 01:35:46.288
I do have something to tell you.

998
01:35:48.081 --> 01:35:51.710
Don't anteaters
get sick of only eating ants?

999
01:35:54.171 --> 01:35:55.839
In times of turbulence,

1000
01:35:56.548 --> 01:35:58.467
a hero always appears.

1001
01:36:02.638 --> 01:36:06.600
I'll throw you in prison
right now
if you try to fool me again.

1002
01:36:10.437 --> 01:36:13.690
It's the case attracting
all the media attention.

1003
01:36:13.941 --> 01:36:16.193
And the only one
who can solve it

1004
01:36:16.401 --> 01:36:18.779
is you, Prosecutor!

1005
01:36:19.112 --> 01:36:22.157
After you crack this case,
you'll be real famous.

1006
01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:25.702
How do you like that?
Mr. Shark?

1007
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:49.643
What is it?

1008
01:36:50.519 --> 01:36:55.065
It's been a while, sir.
I'm busy.
Let's keep it short.

1009
01:36:55.649 --> 01:36:59.152
If I could keep it short,
why come see you?

1010
01:37:01.989 --> 01:37:08.829
I don't know where to begin...
You trying to squeeze
some last pennies out of me?

1011
01:37:10.247 --> 01:37:13.709
I'm talking about
helping each other.

1012
01:37:15.711 --> 01:37:18.672
Get in.
Let's talk on the way.

1013
01:37:57.294 --> 01:37:59.213
You look quite worn out.

1014
01:37:59.796 --> 01:38:01.256
How are things?

1015
01:38:02.299 --> 01:38:05.052
You showed up after
5 years to ask me that?

1016
01:38:05.844 --> 01:38:10.265
Listen, you don't have to
make things complicated.

1017
01:38:11.058 --> 01:38:14.311
I'm not coming to you
with empty hands.

1018
01:38:19.191 --> 01:38:21.777
A month after the election
on Independence Day

1019
01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:23.898
there'll be a special pardon.

1020
01:38:24.196 --> 01:38:26.615
And another on Thanksgiving.

1021
01:38:27.824 --> 01:38:31.203
I arranged everything for you
to come out then.

1022
01:38:31.411 --> 01:38:33.956
I'm mad dog Byun Jae-wook.

1023
01:38:35.707 --> 01:38:38.919
You know me.
I can't bear a false accusation.

1024
01:38:40.003 --> 01:38:41.755
Got something up your sleeve?

1025
01:38:43.131 --> 01:38:46.218
Why go overboard like this?

1026
01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:49.346
I remember you were
at least a man of sense.

1027
01:38:50.639 --> 01:38:54.810
There is nothing
a framed ex-prosecutor can't do.

1028
01:38:58.939 --> 01:39:00.941
You still don't get it, do you?

1029
01:39:02.901 --> 01:39:05.279
You put yourself in this mess.

1030
01:39:16.665 --> 01:39:19.668
Please save me.
I'll confess everything.

1031
01:39:20.586 --> 01:39:21.837
Stand up.

1032
01:39:32.055 --> 01:39:34.516
You should've acted
more like a man.

1033
01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:37.811
I can't...breathe...

1034
01:39:47.321 --> 01:39:48.989
5 years ago, that night

1035
01:39:50.282 --> 01:39:53.660
I told you to hand
Lee Jin-seok over to Yang.

1036
01:39:54.578 --> 01:39:55.954
Don't you remember?

1037
01:39:57.915 --> 01:40:00.083
If you had listened to me

1038
01:40:01.084 --> 01:40:03.462
none of this would
have happened.

1039
01:40:05.464 --> 01:40:07.549
Don't blame me.

1040
01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.596
Give that testimony in court.

1041
01:40:13.889 --> 01:40:16.725
I did this for 25 years.

1042
01:40:16.767 --> 01:40:21.980
Don't you remember
who taught you?
You can't get me.

1043
01:40:24.566 --> 01:40:27.152
Still the same,
you and your bluffing.

1044
01:40:27.903 --> 01:40:31.073
Do you still secretly put
water in your soju?

1045
01:40:32.866 --> 01:40:35.160
You act so manly,

1046
01:40:35.869 --> 01:40:38.830
but you're a weak bastard.

1047
01:40:47.297 --> 01:40:48.507
Alright then.

1048
01:40:50.008 --> 01:40:52.052
See you in court.

1049
01:41:08.026 --> 01:41:10.404
You look really terrible.

1050
01:41:11.363 --> 01:41:13.448
Don't you want to spend

1051
01:41:14.116 --> 01:41:16.034
the rest of your term in peace?

1052
01:41:17.369 --> 01:41:18.370
Here.

1053
01:41:21.123 --> 01:41:24.626
He's just someone
you met in prison.

1054
01:41:25.085 --> 01:41:26.712
You come first.

1055
01:41:40.267 --> 01:41:46.231
Mr. Woo, a word please!
You're summoned as a witness,
what will you testify?

1056
01:41:46.523 --> 01:41:51.570
The truth is that...
I'm not sure why I was called
at this critical time.

1057
01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:55.449
They say Byun will reveal
the true offender.

1058
01:41:56.617 --> 01:41:58.660
I know nothing about this.

1059
01:41:58.911 --> 01:42:01.121
But if he was falsely accused,

1060
01:42:01.663 --> 01:42:06.376
I hope he can prove
himself innocent
and return to society.

1061
01:42:06.418 --> 01:42:08.462
Any comment on
the campaign slush fund?

1062
01:42:08.504 --> 01:42:11.381
Nothing further to say.
How do you feel right now?

1063
01:42:11.423 --> 01:42:15.135
Please say something!
Any thoughts on Byun
pleading not guilty?

1064
01:42:25.395 --> 01:42:28.565
No. 3820!
Depart for the court, come out!

1065
01:42:39.952 --> 01:42:41.203
Captain!

1066
01:42:41.745 --> 01:42:45.707
- What is it?
- Warden wants to see you.
- What for?
- I don't know, sir.

1067
01:42:48.210 --> 01:42:50.045
Stand against the wall.

1068
01:42:52.631 --> 01:42:54.258
You stay right there.

1069
01:43:02.724 --> 01:43:03.934
Young-cheol!

1070
01:43:04.434 --> 01:43:05.644
Hey buddy.

1071
01:43:06.478 --> 01:43:07.855
Young-cheol!

1072
01:43:09.106 --> 01:43:10.899
Weren't you transferred?

1073
01:43:28.125 --> 01:43:29.209
I am sorry, sir.

1074
01:43:31.879 --> 01:43:33.088
I truly am.

1075
01:43:44.933 --> 01:43:52.107
What is with you?
What happened?
Guard! Guard!
Anyone there? Damn it!

1076
01:43:56.987 --> 01:43:59.615
The court will have a recess

1077
01:44:00.032 --> 01:44:01.825
due to a delay
in the defendant's arrival.

1078
01:44:02.826 --> 01:44:05.454
We will resume in half an hour.

1079
01:44:11.043 --> 01:44:12.044
What?

1080
01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.798
I understand.

1081
01:44:19.551 --> 01:44:21.136
What's going on?

1082
01:44:21.303 --> 01:44:23.180
He was stabbed.

1083
01:44:25.516 --> 01:44:26.517
What?

1084
01:44:26.892 --> 01:44:31.230
I get a strong sense
that my life is screwed
because of you two.

1085
01:44:31.939 --> 01:44:34.274
Why on earth
did I listen to you?

1086
01:44:36.693 --> 01:44:38.070
Goddamn it.

1087
01:44:40.447 --> 01:44:42.032
What should we do?

1088
01:44:42.908 --> 01:44:45.536
We? Who are we?

1089
01:44:47.955 --> 01:44:50.082
You think I'm your mate?

1090
01:44:50.916 --> 01:44:53.210
Sorry for keeping you.

1091
01:44:53.710 --> 01:44:55.462
We'll wrap it up soon.

1092
01:44:55.879 --> 01:44:57.214
It's okay.

1093
01:44:58.715 --> 01:45:01.093
Don't worry too much,
Congressman.

1094
01:45:01.301 --> 01:45:03.846
I don't worry about you.

1095
01:45:04.555 --> 01:45:07.808
You always think one step ahead.

1096
01:45:08.267 --> 01:45:10.978
Why should I be worried?
Is this Korean Air?

1097
01:45:11.019 --> 01:45:13.647
I want the earliest flight ticket
to Koreatown in the US!

1098
01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:17.276
Wherever works fine.
The closest one to K-Town!

1099
01:45:19.987 --> 01:45:21.613
Why's it so expensive?

1100
01:45:24.241 --> 01:45:25.242
Damn it!

1101
01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:44.636
I don't think we can
proceed like this.

1102
01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:46.680
Don't you think, prosecutor?

1103
01:45:51.393 --> 01:45:53.395
Can we wait a bit longer?

1104
01:45:53.729 --> 01:45:57.357
The defendant's condition
has not been officially reported.

1105
01:45:57.566 --> 01:46:00.354
There's no reason
to kill any more time.

1106
01:46:01.236 --> 01:46:07.075
The court will adjourn
due to the defendant's absence
and will be rescheduled later.

1107
01:46:07.409 --> 01:46:09.203
Please wait, your honor!

1108
01:47:00.546 --> 01:47:01.630
I am sorry.

1109
01:47:02.339 --> 01:47:05.551
Something happened on the way.
I apologize, your honor.

1110
01:47:05.801 --> 01:47:08.512
I see.
You should keep to the schedule.

1111
01:47:09.888 --> 01:47:12.099
The court is resumed.

1112
01:47:12.474 --> 01:47:15.602
First, witness for the defense...

1113
01:47:17.813 --> 01:47:18.939
Mr. Han Chi-won?

1114
01:47:26.989 --> 01:47:28.115
Mr. Han.

1115
01:47:28.782 --> 01:47:31.451
Did you work for Far East
Construction 5 years ago?

1116
01:47:31.785 --> 01:47:38.417
Yes, I did.
Then you must've been close
to the victim, Lee Jin-seok.

1117
01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:39.543
Of course.

1118
01:47:40.252 --> 01:47:42.629
We shared life's
joys and sorrows.

1119
01:47:42.921 --> 01:47:44.673
What was he like, Lee Jin-seok?

1120
01:47:45.424 --> 01:47:47.217
A good, sensitive man.

1121
01:47:47.426 --> 01:47:49.636
A rare thing in that field.

1122
01:47:50.345 --> 01:47:52.181
But he suffered
breathing problems

1123
01:47:52.222 --> 01:47:55.058
and couldn't even
run to catch a bus.

1124
01:47:55.517 --> 01:47:56.894
He always carried an inhaler.

1125
01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:58.896
- An inhaler?
- Yes.

1126
01:47:59.438 --> 01:48:04.193
By an inhaler,
do you mean
a nebulizer for asthmatics?

1127
01:48:04.359 --> 01:48:05.485
Yes, that's right.

1128
01:48:05.527 --> 01:48:11.408
Then that nebulizer must've
been indispensable to him.
Of course!

1129
01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:15.704
He'd die instantly without it.
As he can't breathe.

1130
01:48:15.787 --> 01:48:17.456
Understood, thank you.

1131
01:48:19.416 --> 01:48:21.502
Witness, did you know

1132
01:48:21.752 --> 01:48:24.755
Jang Hyun-seok, president
of Far East Construction?

1133
01:48:25.339 --> 01:48:26.590
I sure did.

1134
01:48:27.591 --> 01:48:30.093
He was like a big brother to me.

1135
01:48:30.177 --> 01:48:34.306
I worked for him at the scene
of the police assault case

1136
01:48:34.932 --> 01:48:37.893
and recently
on an election campaign.

1137
01:48:37.935 --> 01:48:40.270
Which campaign office
did you work for?

1138
01:48:45.234 --> 01:48:47.694
Am I fully protected here?

1139
01:48:48.111 --> 01:48:50.572
Witness, be assured.

1140
01:48:52.282 --> 01:48:53.408
Thank you, your honor.

1141
01:48:56.370 --> 01:48:59.957
The campaign office for
Mr. Woo Jong-Gil over there.

1142
01:49:01.083 --> 01:49:03.001
Can you specify your role there?

1143
01:49:03.126 --> 01:49:06.964
I delivered boxes
full of cash from Mr. Jang

1144
01:49:07.339 --> 01:49:10.634
to Mr. Woo's campaign office.

1145
01:49:11.009 --> 01:49:15.848
Do you have evidence
for what you just said?

1146
01:49:16.265 --> 01:49:22.479
I have pictures on Facebook
from the bird sanctuary protest
and my days on the campaign.

1147
01:49:27.609 --> 01:49:29.069
I submit this material
as evidence.

1148
01:49:40.497 --> 01:49:41.874
No further questions.

1149
01:49:42.791 --> 01:49:45.043
Prosecutor, please proceed.

1150
01:49:45.711 --> 01:49:51.758
Mr. Han Chi-won.
Can you confirm that everything
you just said is the truth?

1151
01:49:52.384 --> 01:49:55.137
I've never lied in my life.

1152
01:49:57.848 --> 01:49:59.850
Is it true that Jang Hyun-seok's
slush fund

1153
01:49:59.975 --> 01:50:04.062
was used as campaign money
for Woo Jong-Gil?

1154
01:50:05.522 --> 01:50:09.860
Yes, it is 100% accurate.

1155
01:50:10.652 --> 01:50:12.237
Thank you.

1156
01:50:13.238 --> 01:50:14.323
No further questions.

1157
01:50:19.536 --> 01:50:20.537
Yes.

1158
01:50:20.913 --> 01:50:23.832
Hey.
What are you doing?

1159
01:50:24.458 --> 01:50:26.376
Are you a prosecutor
or a defense attorney?

1160
01:50:27.211 --> 01:50:30.005
I'm trying to reveal
the truth as prosecutor.

1161
01:50:30.422 --> 01:50:33.800
You realize you're stepping
into very dangerous waters?

1162
01:50:34.009 --> 01:50:35.135
Yes, I do.

1163
01:50:36.261 --> 01:50:39.056
But I am certain about this.
Let's continue.

1164
01:50:39.348 --> 01:50:40.349
Alright.

1165
01:50:41.850 --> 01:50:43.810
Let's see where it leads us.

1166
01:50:43.852 --> 01:50:44.853
Yes, your honor.

1167
01:50:46.647 --> 01:50:47.731
Next...

1168
01:50:48.315 --> 01:50:51.902
Witness for the prosecution,
Mr. Woo Jong-Gil,
please come forward.

1169
01:50:55.072 --> 01:50:58.617
I solemnly swear to tell
nothing but the truth

1170
01:50:58.951 --> 01:51:01.787
and will be punished
if I do otherwise.

1171
01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.543
Prosecutor,
the witness is yours.

1172
01:51:09.962 --> 01:51:10.963
Witness,

1173
01:51:12.130 --> 01:51:15.008
how would you describe
your relationship with Jang?

1174
01:51:18.387 --> 01:51:22.850
He's one of my supporters,
but not a personal relation.

1175
01:51:23.767 --> 01:51:31.233
These documents show that
Jang was charged four times
from 1988 to 2006
for organized violence

1176
01:51:31.483 --> 01:51:33.569
and circulation of illegal funds.

1177
01:51:39.199 --> 01:51:43.370
But all of his cases were dropped
by the same prosecutor.

1178
01:51:43.704 --> 01:51:44.705
Tell me.

1179
01:51:45.247 --> 01:51:47.749
What name is written as prosecutor?

1180
01:51:49.710 --> 01:51:52.462
Do you feel reluctant to say it?
It's my name.

1181
01:51:53.797 --> 01:52:02.264
But how is this related to
my testifying as a witness?
I am saying that you're not
unconnected to Lee's death.

1182
01:52:02.431 --> 01:52:09.146
Then you should reveal
the circumstances of his death
at the prosecutor's office.
Why keep straying from the issue?

1183
01:52:09.313 --> 01:52:11.982
And I remind you,

1184
01:52:13.192 --> 01:52:17.237
I'm a witness
for the prosecution
who should receive
your protection.

1185
01:52:17.571 --> 01:52:23.076
Identify well who's friend or foe.
Do I really have to explain
A to Z about the trial?

1186
01:52:23.952 --> 01:52:25.454
Mr. Prosecutor?

1187
01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:31.126
No further questions.

1188
01:52:32.669 --> 01:52:33.795
Defendant,

1189
01:52:34.463 --> 01:52:37.633
would you like to proceed?
Yes, of course.

1190
01:52:40.135 --> 01:52:45.432
Mr. Woo, who do you think
killed Lee Jin-seok?

1191
01:52:45.599 --> 01:52:58.070
Isn't his death the reason
you wear that uniform?
Then why do you think
I killed Lee Jin-seok?
I guess you would know best.
That's not for me to answer.

1192
01:52:59.196 --> 01:53:01.573
For every homicide,
there should be a motive.

1193
01:53:02.324 --> 01:53:07.955
The one who benefits
from the victim's death
is usually the one
we identify as a suspect.

1194
01:53:08.664 --> 01:53:13.418
So in this homicide case,
who reaped the largest benefit?

1195
01:53:14.253 --> 01:53:16.046
As you all see, not me.

1196
01:53:16.213 --> 01:53:27.224
The one with free access to
the prosecutor's office,
who can destroy evidence,
manipulate the court
and use false charges to get
a sentence of 15 years.

1197
01:53:29.893 --> 01:53:31.812
Shouldn't this person
be the suspect?

1198
01:53:34.314 --> 01:53:36.191
What are you talking about?

1199
01:53:37.818 --> 01:53:42.072
I am asking you
why you killed Lee Jin-seok.

1200
01:53:46.076 --> 01:53:47.828
Listen, defendant.

1201
01:53:48.745 --> 01:53:50.289
Do you have evidence?

1202
01:53:50.789 --> 01:53:57.796
You mustn't falsely accuse
a candidate for congress
with no evidence but wordplay.
Don't you think, your honor?

1203
01:53:58.839 --> 01:54:02.801
Delete the defendant's
questions from the record.

1204
01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:09.266
Defendant, please continue.

1205
01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:16.481
Order in the court!

1206
01:54:16.982 --> 01:54:19.568
No further questions?

1207
01:54:21.153 --> 01:54:28.535
Witness Park Joon-beom
overturned his testimony
stating that Lee Jin-seok
was an asthmatic.

1208
01:54:29.411 --> 01:54:40.464
This is the list of evidence
from the crime scene.
But the inhaler,
indispensable for an asthmatic
doesn't appear on the list.

1209
01:54:43.383 --> 01:54:52.226
The victim had the inhaler,
but it disappeared
after his death.
If so, we should assume
someone hid or destroyed it.

1210
01:54:52.518 --> 01:54:58.148
And that someone must be
the real culprit.

1211
01:55:08.659 --> 01:55:13.163
Witness,
do you know who hid it?

1212
01:55:13.455 --> 01:55:16.875
How should I know?
Let me ask again.

1213
01:55:18.335 --> 01:55:20.087
Do you know who hid it?

1214
01:55:20.128 --> 01:55:22.506
I said for certain I don't know.

1215
01:55:31.139 --> 01:55:32.641
I submit this as evidence.

1216
01:55:33.809 --> 01:55:36.061
It wasn't accepted in advance.

1217
01:55:41.942 --> 01:55:45.112
Unless the prosecution agrees...
I agree.

1218
01:55:46.029 --> 01:55:47.531
Evidence accepted then.

1219
01:55:53.787 --> 01:55:56.248
You should wash your car.

1220
01:55:56.623 --> 01:55:58.125
$50K.

1221
01:55:58.125 --> 01:56:00.954
It'll be wired after the election.

1222
01:56:02.129 --> 01:56:03.964
Don't ever come see me again.

1223
01:56:05.090 --> 01:56:07.342
Thank you, sir.

1224
01:56:08.802 --> 01:56:12.514
By the way, you disposed
of that inhaler back then?

1225
01:56:19.688 --> 01:56:25.527
This is the victim's inhaler
that disappeared
from the crime scene.

1226
01:56:26.570 --> 01:56:29.114
Chief Interrogator Kang
heard in the recording

1227
01:56:29.156 --> 01:56:33.076
kept it in secret from you
for the sake of his safety.

1228
01:56:35.329 --> 01:56:37.164
I see your time in jail

1229
01:56:38.665 --> 01:56:41.043
has turned you
into a real criminal.

1230
01:56:42.419 --> 01:56:45.339
If you continue this farce,
I'll leave the stand.

1231
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:48.842
Sit down, witness!
Sit down, I said!

1232
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:52.095
Do you still deny it
even with the evidence?

1233
01:56:52.888 --> 01:56:56.600
Did you hide the inhaler,
knowing Lee was asthmatic?

1234
01:56:57.059 --> 01:57:01.980
And then frame me for all this?
Judge, won't you do anything
about this circus?

1235
01:57:06.318 --> 01:57:10.781
Denial only makes you uglier.

1236
01:57:12.908 --> 01:57:14.826
You should at least

1237
01:57:15.786 --> 01:57:18.288
be humble before the evidence.

1238
01:57:20.582 --> 01:57:23.794
You call it evidence!
Woo Jong-Gil,

1239
01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.296
you're finished.

1240
01:57:27.881 --> 01:57:29.174
You madman.

1241
01:57:30.342 --> 01:57:34.972
Once you were a prosecutor,
but now you entice the court
with phony evidence?

1242
01:57:36.682 --> 01:57:37.683
Phony?

1243
01:57:39.017 --> 01:57:40.853
How would you know?

1244
01:57:41.937 --> 01:57:44.481
How would you know
if it's real or phony?

1245
01:57:48.402 --> 01:57:49.945
The inhaler?

1246
01:57:51.488 --> 01:57:54.449
That should be floating
somewhere in the Han River.

1247
01:58:00.539 --> 01:58:01.832
The inhaler?

1248
01:58:03.542 --> 01:58:06.336
That should be floating
somewhere in the Han River.

1249
01:58:12.843 --> 01:58:14.178
I wanted to hear you

1250
01:58:15.179 --> 01:58:17.723
say it yourself
in front of everyone.

1251
01:58:25.147 --> 01:58:33.822
The witness confessed
to suppressing evidence.
I request you arrest Woo
as a suspect for murder.
Shut the hell up!

1252
01:58:34.198 --> 01:58:39.494
You think you'll
escape this unharmed?
What?
Let go of me, bastards!

1253
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:40.996
Witness!

1254
01:58:41.538 --> 01:58:42.915
Obey the court's order!

1255
01:58:43.207 --> 01:58:46.835
You all try to frame me
with this pathetic scheme!

1256
01:58:47.628 --> 01:58:48.921
Don't you know who I am?

1257
01:58:50.631 --> 01:58:55.469
Detain him right now!
Stop it! Damn bastards!
You think I'll go down alone?

1258
01:58:56.011 --> 01:58:57.888
This is all a political show!

1259
01:58:58.263 --> 01:59:01.225
You're all being fooled!

1260
01:59:01.308 --> 01:59:03.519
Congressman Kang!

1261
01:59:04.811 --> 01:59:06.230
Judge!

1262
01:59:12.402 --> 01:59:14.613
Please, Judge Choi...

1263
01:59:23.539 --> 01:59:28.252
Defendant, do you have
anything left to say?

1264
01:59:37.886 --> 01:59:39.930
I was a violent prosecutor.

1265
01:59:42.015 --> 01:59:50.107
I conducted
forced investigations.
I violated human rights
and abused my influence
in the name of public power.

1266
01:59:52.359 --> 01:59:54.111
Therefore, I am guilty.

1267
01:59:59.533 --> 02:00:02.703
I paid the price for my crimes

1268
02:00:04.913 --> 02:00:06.957
serving 5 years in prison.

1269
02:00:11.461 --> 02:00:16.425
Please let me return
to society now.

1270
02:00:19.761 --> 02:00:26.351
Today Seoul Central Prosecution
arrested and charged
Woo Jong-Gil,
a former
congressional candidate,

1271
02:00:26.393 --> 02:00:42.326
for conspiring with
Far East Construction
to destroy evidence
and commit murder.
The prosecution also uncovered
a plot by Woo and Jang
to frame former prosecutor
Byun Jae-wook

1272
02:00:42.451 --> 02:00:44.161
for the crimes they committed.

1273
02:00:44.411 --> 02:00:46.496
Are you personally close to
Candidate Woo?

1274
02:00:46.538 --> 02:00:48.790
A few calls between
members of the same party.

1275
02:00:49.499 --> 02:00:52.127
Can't I call the person who
will inherit my precinct?

1276
02:00:52.252 --> 02:00:54.338
- Please comment, sir!
- Hey, don't take photos!

1277
02:01:28.997 --> 02:01:32.417
Kyung-gyu!
- Here!
- Hey, this way!

1278
02:01:49.184 --> 02:01:51.562
Why are you standing there
like an idiot?

1279
02:01:56.316 --> 02:02:00.070
No one came to see you?
What kind of life
have you led so far?

1280
02:02:01.238 --> 02:02:02.948
Guess I'm all you've got.

1281
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:04.157
Have a bite.

1282
02:02:08.912 --> 02:02:11.874
Why are you acting
like a stranger?

1283
02:02:12.708 --> 02:02:18.463
Brother, I have a killer item.
Let's talk it over
on the way to Seoul.

1284
02:02:18.505 --> 02:02:20.716
Your intelligence
combined with my skills, wow!

1285
02:02:24.928 --> 02:02:30.100
Don't be difficult
on a day like this.
Come on, my car's over there.
The bus station is really far.

1286
02:02:30.642 --> 02:02:33.061
John 16:33.

1287
02:02:35.856 --> 02:02:37.900
Let's live honestly, shall we?
