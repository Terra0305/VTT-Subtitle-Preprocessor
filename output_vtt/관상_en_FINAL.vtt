1
00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:10.904
You came to kill me.

2
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.907
Kill you?

3
00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:17.369
We were just preparing
your medicine.

4
00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.121
Get out.

5
00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.791
I’m sure
I heard his voice.

6
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.552
We doubled the security
as you ordered.

7
00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.306
Nobody will harm you.

8
00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:40.601
You’re the most powerful man
in this country.

9
00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:49.318
I don’t have power
anymore.

10
00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:54.239
There’s nothing left.

11
00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:58.619
My wife and daughter
are dead.

12
00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.957
I’ve nothing left.

13
00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:08.879
Still the king gave
you the medicine,

14
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.299
that chair, and the cane.

15
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:16.136
That’s why I have to
defend myself.

16
00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:21.183
The medicine’s no use if
I’m going to be beheaded.

17
00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:25.187
Beheaded?
How could say such a thing?

18
00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:30.400
He told me
that’s how I’ll die.

19
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.319
He said it’s on my face.

20
00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.989
Who said
something like that?

21
00:02:36.532 --> 00:02:42.371
The face reader.

22
00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:46.458
Physiognomy?
Isn’t that superstition?

23
00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.003
That’s because you
never met him.

24
00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.800
He knew everything.

25
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:58.846
He figured out everything

26
00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:03.267
just by looking at a face.

27
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:12.192
He was the greatest
face reader in Joseon.

28
00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:31.336
Where could this house be?

29
00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:35.757
I heard it’s near here.

30
00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:48.061
I can’t walk anymore.

31
00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:05.704
What the...

32
00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.716
We’re here.

33
00:04:21.512 --> 00:04:24.139
Gosh, she’s heavy.

34
00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.767
Nice atmosphere.

35
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.270
Good view.

36
00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.272
Who are you?

37
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:38.278
Is this the house of
the famous face reader?

38
00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:41.573
What?

39
00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.286
Oh didn’t I tell you?

40
00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:50.040
They’re here to buy
my brushes.

41
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.626
You’re looking
for weasel fur?

42
00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:57.589
Something like that.

43
00:05:00.092 --> 00:05:01.844
I’m going to the market.

44
00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:03.554
Oh, yes sure.

45
00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.807
Don’t rush!

46
00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:13.063
My nephew hates
face reading.

47
00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:15.315
This way, please.

48
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.609
Let’s go inside.

49
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.869
This is the weasel tail.

50
00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:28.287
Very expensive.

51
00:05:28.287 --> 00:05:30.873
Not interested?

52
00:05:30.873 --> 00:05:34.376
Gosh,
he’s practically naked.

53
00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:36.378
Nae-kyeong, get up.

54
00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:37.671
Get up.

55
00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:43.760
- Uhm, yummy...
- Alright, wake up.

56
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.722
He talks in his sleep.

57
00:05:46.722 --> 00:05:51.935
He may look pitiful,
but he’s a professional.

58
00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.354
Nae-kyeong!
You have clients!

59
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.316
They’re waiting.

60
00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:00.485
I drank too much.

61
00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:04.031
They want to know if it’s

62
00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:07.743
a good business to
import silk from China.

63
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.291
Go away.

64
00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:16.877
What?

65
00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:21.757
I don’t talk to liars.

66
00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.849
Mister,

67
00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.143
your eyes say you’re not
good with money.

68
00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:37.689
Your eyebrows and round eyes
are not for a businessman.

69
00:06:38.357 --> 00:06:42.653
More for a eunuch
or a secretary.

70
00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:48.867
Madame is good in business
but too good to be selling just silk.

71
00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:53.163
Peachy face and red lips say
you could be a shaman.

72
00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:56.416
But highly unlikely.

73
00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:59.670
Why did you lie?

74
00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:04.550
I don’t know what you want,
but leave if you’re going to lie.

75
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.765
You take me for a fool?
Lying to me like that?

76
00:07:11.974 --> 00:07:14.518
Where are you from?

77
00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.186
Are you laughing?

78
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.398
Don’t lie to my
brother-in-law.

79
00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:23.819
How dare you lie
to his face so blatantly.

80
00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:28.824
Good.
I’m glad I came.

81
00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:37.207
Do you know...

82
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.257
You think I’m stupid?

83
00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:52.222
High officials go there
for face readings and stuff.

84
00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:55.851
She’s the madame.

85
00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.647
You’re a face reader?

86
00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:03.150
You don’t look like one.

87
00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.611
I’m an amateur.

88
00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:09.448
My experiences
have taught me...

89
00:08:10.032 --> 00:08:11.533
a little bit about
reading people.

90
00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:17.289
Hey, watch your hand!

91
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:24.504
Why don’t you
work for me?

92
00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:31.386
You’ll get to use
your talents to the fullest.

93
00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:37.100
I’m the business partner.

94
00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.355
He only does
the reading.

95
00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:45.108
We will pay
for your service.

96
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.367
Take the offer
when it’s there.

97
00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:56.954
Life’s too short
to waste it away.

98
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.084
Do you want to live
like this forever?

99
00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:04.419
Weasel?
Yeah, right.

100
00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:08.340
My back!

101
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.009
Is he any good?

102
00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:14.471
Not just good.
He can rock the world.

103
00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:33.907
Rat whiskers?

104
00:09:36.577 --> 00:09:38.203
Give me more.

105
00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:40.080
You know
those are rare.

106
00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:41.623
Wait here.

107
00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:47.254
My family haven’t had
anything to eat.

108
00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:48.630
Get him out!

109
00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:54.261
Since you can’t pay the tax,
I’ll take her instead.

110
00:09:54.553 --> 00:09:56.180
Sir!

111
00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:58.724
Please don’t!

112
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.685
I have a husband, please!

113
00:10:08.317 --> 00:10:10.068
That bastard!

114
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.364
Are you nuts?
He’s an inspector.

115
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.950
- Let me go!
- Please don’t.

116
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.161
So, you just sit by
and watch?

117
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:23.957
If you do, we’ll all die.

118
00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:27.211
It’ll irritate him more.

119
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.843
Smells good!

120
00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:37.513
You have to turn it over.

121
00:10:37.513 --> 00:10:39.264
Go away!

122
00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.642
You’ve no idea
how to cook meat.

123
00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.189
Jin-hyeong!

124
00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:50.150
Did you eat yet?

125
00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.864
We’re eating
chicken today.

126
00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:58.408
We have chicken!

127
00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.660
It’s chicken day!

128
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.250
What’s with him?

129
00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:13.882
Have plenty.

130
00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.019
How did you
buy a chicken?

131
00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.903
Those people
you saw earlier,

132
00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:37.531
they bought
our brushes.

133
00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:41.618
The brushes are
still there.

134
00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:48.041
Did you read
their faces?

135
00:11:49.168 --> 00:11:51.628
Read their faces?

136
00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:57.593
They were
quite persistent.

137
00:11:57.593 --> 00:11:59.261
Am I not allowed?

138
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.307
How can a scholar do
such a crude thing?

139
00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:09.062
Should I study and take up
a public office then?

140
00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:12.357
Why not?

141
00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.359
You’re asking me why?

142
00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:19.781
A traitor’s family can’t
serve in the government.

143
00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.580
I saw books
in your room.

144
00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:29.041
Don’t even
think about it.

145
00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:30.626
Like your grandpa,

146
00:12:30.626 --> 00:12:32.377
you’ll be harmed
if you work for the government.

147
00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:35.631
No, I’ll work for
the government.

148
00:12:36.215 --> 00:12:41.929
Even if that means I’d be
killed like my grandfather.

149
00:12:46.892 --> 00:12:48.519
How dare you?

150
00:12:55.192 --> 00:12:56.985
You even drink?

151
00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:05.118
I’m not a kid anymore.
I’m over 17 now.

152
00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.455
Jin-hyeong,
finish eating!

153
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:15.337
What ‘s the matter?
He drinks with me sometimes.

154
00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:21.051
You were too harsh.

155
00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:26.807
I want him to give up.

156
00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:28.517
Give up?

157
00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:32.437
Back when you were
following around peddlers,

158
00:13:34.398 --> 00:13:38.652
I tried to drink
myself to death.

159
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.155
When I hung myself
on the girder,

160
00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.616
I saw him looking
at me and crying.

161
00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:47.661
He was about five.

162
00:13:47.953 --> 00:13:50.914
All skin and bones.

163
00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:55.085
“Daddy, save me...”

164
00:13:57.004 --> 00:14:00.840
I started to support
him by begging.

165
00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:07.514
I think he limps because
he didn’t eat properly.

166
00:14:09.141 --> 00:14:13.020
He’s got the intelligence
and writing skills like me,

167
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.857
but not being able to use them
filled him with resentment.

168
00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.321
My poor sister,
married to a doomed family.

169
00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:27.242
Do you know how rich
we were in the past?

170
00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:30.454
All the ladies wanted to
see me from a distance and...

171
00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:33.123
What’s in the past
doesn’t count.

172
00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:42.007
I’m going to Yeon-hong.

173
00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:44.968
What?

174
00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:48.388
We can’t live
like this forever.

175
00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:53.560
I learned face reading
because I had nothing to do.

176
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.271
It’s no use here.

177
00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:00.150
Maybe I can make
big bucks in Hanyang.

178
00:15:00.776 --> 00:15:03.695
I’ll support my family
with my talent.

179
00:15:04.321 --> 00:15:07.491
We’ll eat meat and rice.
Buy new clothes.

180
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:09.993
We’ll live proudly.

181
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:14.957
What do we say
to Jin-hyeong?

182
00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:23.006
We’ll leave him a note saying
we went to sell the brushes.

183
00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:25.342
You can come back here
now and then.

184
00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:33.016
Tomorrow you wake
me up early, okay?

185
00:16:03.422 --> 00:16:04.965
Nae-kyeong!

186
00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:07.676
Jin-hyeong!

187
00:16:08.719 --> 00:16:10.095
Jin-hyeong!

188
00:16:17.978 --> 00:16:20.647
We shouldn’t have
drunk so much.

189
00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.400
Jin-hyeong!

190
00:16:25.986 --> 00:16:28.488
I’m going to study
at a quiet temple.

191
00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.825
When becoming
a government official,

192
00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:35.078
I’ll take you two.

193
00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:37.831
Take care of yourselves.

194
00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:41.627
Please forgive me.

195
00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:53.472
That, that little...

196
00:16:53.472 --> 00:16:55.307
I’ll take him.

197
00:16:59.311 --> 00:17:03.023
We’ll be
leaving soon, too.

198
00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:04.900
Jin-hyeong!

199
00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:47.734
He writes well like his grandpa,
unlike his dad.

200
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:52.865
His leg...

201
00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:56.368
Take care.

202
00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:01.915
My son.

203
00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:06.837
Come on.

204
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.092
I think they’re
staring at us.

205
00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:16.430
It’s because I look good
with grooming.

206
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.223
All dressed up.

207
00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:19.975
I think they’re
looking at me.

208
00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:23.979
Look at them.

209
00:18:23.979 --> 00:18:26.023
Fish out of water!

210
00:18:27.024 --> 00:18:29.151
I know how to deal with
country bumpkins.

211
00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:36.783
Prepare a big feast.

212
00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:39.328
Yes, ma’am.

213
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.457
Hanyang is the best!

214
00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:46.293
Pass me that meat.

215
00:18:52.216 --> 00:18:56.553
We were just tasting.

216
00:18:57.846 --> 00:18:59.973
Just a tiny bit.

217
00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:02.893
- Girls.
- Yes, ma’am.

218
00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.688
What are you doing?

219
00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:10.442
- Where are you...?
- Hey, hey!

220
00:19:11.485 --> 00:19:13.820
What’s going on?!

221
00:19:22.538 --> 00:19:25.165
He’s the best
face reader in town.

222
00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:27.501
Treat him like one.

223
00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:45.894
Sit here, sir.

224
00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:47.312
Pour me a glass.

225
00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:52.359
Can you read my face?

226
00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:57.114
He’s the face reader.
I read hearts.

227
00:19:57.114 --> 00:19:58.156
Hearts?

228
00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:02.077
Yes, here.

229
00:20:03.537 --> 00:20:06.832
How about me?
Men don’t like me.

230
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.795
There you go.

231
00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:13.422
What’s this?

232
00:20:14.298 --> 00:20:18.135
You have pretty round face
but it’s too plain.

233
00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:21.054
Put this on and men will
find you more attractive.

234
00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:22.514
Is that so?

235
00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:23.557
You look much better.

236
00:20:25.726 --> 00:20:28.353
I have a question.

237
00:20:28.854 --> 00:20:34.067
There are two big powers
in this country: Lee and Kim.

238
00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:35.485
They fight everyday,

239
00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:39.823
killing people here and there.
It’s quite terrifying.

240
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.577
Who do you think will
win at in the end?

241
00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:46.580
I heard the rumors
early on.

242
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.041
Lee is Prince Su-yang and
Kim is Kim Jong-seo.

243
00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:50.375
Yes.

244
00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:56.757
But I can’t tell because
I haven’t seen their faces.

245
00:20:56.757 --> 00:21:04.598
People say Lee looks like a wolf
and Kim resembles a tiger.

246
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.434
A wolf and a tiger.

247
00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.186
Let me think.

248
00:21:10.521 --> 00:21:12.105
Aha!

249
00:21:20.364 --> 00:21:22.533
How would I know?

250
00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:24.368
Stronger one will win.

251
00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:29.540
It’s time for the contract.

252
00:21:29.915 --> 00:21:31.416
Contract?

253
00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:34.294
I wouldn’t know
even if I read...

254
00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:37.923
Don’t bore us
with this stuff.

255
00:21:37.923 --> 00:21:39.925
Yeah, don’t make
the ladies wait!

256
00:21:39.925 --> 00:21:42.219
It’s time to read hearts.

257
00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:50.143
Good gracious.
What a mess.

258
00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:53.814
Hey, get up.
Rise and shine!

259
00:21:58.986 --> 00:22:00.612
Who are you?

260
00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:04.783
It’s me.
You don’t remember?

261
00:22:04.783 --> 00:22:07.578
- Get ready for the clients!
- Clients?

262
00:22:07.578 --> 00:22:10.122
Don’t you remember
the contract?

263
00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:13.333
Do you know how much
you drank?

264
00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:18.672
“I agree to see clients
from sun rise to sun down...”

265
00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:21.466
Had fun with the girls
last night?

266
00:22:21.717 --> 00:22:24.303
“...flogging?”
What’s this?

267
00:22:24.303 --> 00:22:27.389
Hey, this isn’t fair.

268
00:22:27.806 --> 00:22:34.438
You think you can
rip us off?

269
00:22:34.438 --> 00:22:39.109
You are so wrong!

270
00:22:41.778 --> 00:22:43.071
Hey, let go!

271
00:22:43.071 --> 00:22:45.157
You little rat!

272
00:22:46.325 --> 00:22:48.076
Let me go!

273
00:22:50.162 --> 00:22:51.788
I’m sorry, sir.

274
00:23:00.797 --> 00:23:03.342
Line up!

275
00:23:03.926 --> 00:23:06.011
How long do we
have to do this?

276
00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.308
This is good.
Making easy bucks!

277
00:23:11.308 --> 00:23:13.602
It’s so easy!

278
00:23:13.977 --> 00:23:19.398
My wits are better
than face reading.

279
00:23:22.152 --> 00:23:24.947
Come quickly.

280
00:23:24.947 --> 00:23:29.034
You still have
twenty more to carry.

281
00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:32.746
Can’t believe this.

282
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.837
We shouldn’t have
drunk that day.

283
00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:42.256
I told you we
should stop!

284
00:23:42.506 --> 00:23:43.423
What?

285
00:23:47.094 --> 00:23:49.054
Oh my gosh!

286
00:23:51.473 --> 00:23:53.684
That’s does it!

287
00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.145
- I’ve had it!
- Hey!

288
00:23:57.145 --> 00:23:58.814
I told you to give up
your temper.

289
00:24:02.943 --> 00:24:05.445
You can’t live like
the old days.

290
00:24:06.238 --> 00:24:08.490
Then you’ll just sit here
and let them do this?

291
00:24:08.782 --> 00:24:13.328
We can’t undo the contract
even if you go beat them up.

292
00:24:13.328 --> 00:24:15.497
You’ll get flogged.

293
00:24:17.583 --> 00:24:25.215
I told you
your temper will ruin you.

294
00:24:27.134 --> 00:24:30.012
Nothing’s solved
by foul temper.

295
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.144
Where are you going?

296
00:24:41.398 --> 00:24:47.321
I’ve been observing for a few days,
this room is quite suspicious.

297
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:50.490
It might be a room for
special clients.

298
00:24:51.992 --> 00:24:56.538
To succeed, you need to
meet the big shots

299
00:25:08.175 --> 00:25:09.551
You see?

300
00:25:15.641 --> 00:25:17.226
Come in.

301
00:25:17.809 --> 00:25:20.187
You two can wait here.

302
00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:35.494
- Was I right?
- Yes.

303
00:25:42.543 --> 00:25:45.712
Look at that flabby ass.

304
00:25:46.004 --> 00:25:48.715
I told you to keep your
muscles tight at all times.

305
00:25:49.925 --> 00:25:51.093
That’s better!

306
00:25:54.137 --> 00:25:57.599
I’m worried I look fat
because of my big breasts.

307
00:26:00.435 --> 00:26:01.228
Take it down!

308
00:26:01.395 --> 00:26:05.315
Do you want me to pop
them like a pig’s bladder?

309
00:26:05.566 --> 00:26:07.734
No thanks!

310
00:26:12.906 --> 00:26:14.575
Let me see.

311
00:26:19.121 --> 00:26:21.123
She’s blocking again.

312
00:26:23.667 --> 00:26:25.961
Looks like
you’ll bear a son.

313
00:26:27.796 --> 00:26:30.424
Sir Jang Nyeong from
the Inspection Board is here.

314
00:26:30.424 --> 00:26:34.469
- Isn’t he Kim Jong-seo’s man?
- Yes.

315
00:26:35.262 --> 00:26:37.596
There’s been
a murder case.

316
00:26:37.556 --> 00:26:39.933
He wants you to find
the murderer.

317
00:26:39.933 --> 00:26:46.565
How would I know that
just by looking at faces?

318
00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:50.569
That’s crazy.

319
00:26:54.573 --> 00:26:57.284
Sir Jang Nyeong!

320
00:26:57.701 --> 00:27:03.248
It’s an honor to serve you
at my humble place.

321
00:27:03.916 --> 00:27:07.211
I’m sorry for visiting
you like this.

322
00:27:07.211 --> 00:27:09.004
No problem.

323
00:27:09.004 --> 00:27:13.217
Inspection Board official’s
involved in this case.

324
00:27:14.092 --> 00:27:17.846
It’s quite urgent.
I heard you’re very good.

325
00:27:17.846 --> 00:27:19.638
That’s right.

326
00:27:19.598 --> 00:27:22.267
I’ve heard the gist of it,

327
00:27:22.684 --> 00:27:27.189
I know it’s inconvenient,
but I’m refraining from...

328
00:27:36.406 --> 00:27:37.658
Sir Jang Nyeong!

329
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.618
Who’s this?

330
00:27:42.204 --> 00:27:45.415
I’m Kim Nae-kyeong,
her business partner.

331
00:27:46.416 --> 00:27:49.336
Why were you in there?

332
00:27:52.464 --> 00:27:55.300
Precious view in there.

333
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.595
“Private” readings, huh?
I want referrals.

334
00:27:59.179 --> 00:28:03.684
Madame here told me to assist you
in your investigation, sir

335
00:28:03.684 --> 00:28:05.811
Is that so?

336
00:28:06.478 --> 00:28:08.939
You knew I’d come!

337
00:28:18.198 --> 00:28:21.368
These three were
at the site.

338
00:28:21.952 --> 00:28:24.705
But they won’t admit
even after tortures.

339
00:28:25.038 --> 00:28:27.499
I’m sure
it’s one of them.

340
00:28:40.804 --> 00:28:43.307
The murder was
committed this morning.

341
00:28:43.307 --> 00:28:45.809
You probably still
have the body.

342
00:28:46.602 --> 00:28:48.437
I’d like to see it.

343
00:28:50.689 --> 00:28:52.357
If you look at
the face of the victim,

344
00:28:52.357 --> 00:28:55.611
broad forehead and
high ear bones,

345
00:28:55.611 --> 00:28:59.656
meaning she’s destined
to live a long life.

346
00:29:00.908 --> 00:29:04.077
It’s clearly
a murder case.

347
00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:07.789
Are you the husband?

348
00:29:10.459 --> 00:29:12.628
Why did you
kill your wife?

349
00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:15.255
What?

350
00:29:15.756 --> 00:29:20.177
My reading tells me you weren’t
compatible with each other.

351
00:29:21.136 --> 00:29:24.097
It must have
been difficult.

352
00:29:24.598 --> 00:29:30.020
Faces of weasel and chicken.
They can’t hit it off together.

353
00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:34.566
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

354
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.486
- Take him into custody.
- Yes, sir.

355
00:29:37.945 --> 00:29:44.785
Meeting a right match is
more important than good face.

356
00:29:45.244 --> 00:29:48.956
If it weren’t for you, we would’ve
condemned an innocent man.

357
00:29:52.209 --> 00:29:57.464
It’s my pleasure to
help the innocent.

358
00:30:00.092 --> 00:30:04.263
This is way more than
what we made before!

359
00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.015
We gotta get out of here.

360
00:30:07.015 --> 00:30:10.060
How do we trick
that vile woman?

361
00:30:12.354 --> 00:30:15.649
Kim Nae-kyeong, are you
the best face reader in town?

362
00:30:16.692 --> 00:30:18.026
Who are you?

363
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:27.578
Paeng-heon!

364
00:30:45.262 --> 00:30:46.847
Is this him?

365
00:30:49.266 --> 00:30:53.020
The man who found
the murderer by reading faces?

366
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.147
Yes, he’s unbelievable.

367
00:30:56.398 --> 00:30:57.858
What should we do?

368
00:31:21.423 --> 00:31:24.343
He could be a problem.
Kill him.

369
00:31:33.435 --> 00:31:35.062
You have to go.

370
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:41.568
- Take care of him.
- Yes, sir.

371
00:32:05.676 --> 00:32:06.885
Let’s go.

372
00:32:13.684 --> 00:32:15.894
They dropped
something here.

373
00:32:57.811 --> 00:32:59.354
What are you doing?

374
00:33:06.028 --> 00:33:11.074
I was in a dust storm
in my dream.

375
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:13.076
And now I have real sand
in my mouth.

376
00:33:13.202 --> 00:33:15.579
That’s from the muddy well.

377
00:33:16.121 --> 00:33:18.207
I had sandy mouth, too.

378
00:33:19.541 --> 00:33:24.213
So the murderer I caught
was one of Su-yang’s men?

379
00:33:24.213 --> 00:33:26.173
That’s why they
tried to kill us.

380
00:33:26.757 --> 00:33:27.841
Correct.

381
00:33:29.051 --> 00:33:36.308
If not for Kim Jong-seo’s men,
we’d be dead by now.

382
00:33:36.642 --> 00:33:39.228
That’s what I heard.

383
00:33:40.437 --> 00:33:43.315
He could be a problem.
Kill him.

384
00:33:44.358 --> 00:33:45.692
Let’s leave.

385
00:33:46.193 --> 00:33:46.985
What?

386
00:33:46.985 --> 00:33:49.071
Money’s not
worth our lives.

387
00:33:55.786 --> 00:33:58.080
- Where are you going?
- Gosh!

388
00:33:59.581 --> 00:34:00.874
Sir Jang Nyeong.

389
00:34:02.543 --> 00:34:06.338
I am a simple face reader,
doing simple work,

390
00:34:06.338 --> 00:34:09.633
I think it best to stay out
of politics.

391
00:34:09.633 --> 00:34:11.885
I’m sorry about that.

392
00:34:11.885 --> 00:34:13.720
No need.

393
00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.764
We’ll be off then.

394
00:34:17.224 --> 00:34:18.892
Before you go,

395
00:34:18.892 --> 00:34:21.520
there’s someone
who wants to see you.

396
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.146
Why don’t you come
say hello?

397
00:34:23.313 --> 00:34:27.317
- Perhaps another time.
- Yes, later.

398
00:34:27.317 --> 00:34:29.152
- There’s no later.
- No, thank you.

399
00:34:29.152 --> 00:34:30.571
He’s a busy man.

400
00:34:30.571 --> 00:34:31.947
We’re fine!

401
00:34:32.447 --> 00:34:33.824
That’s weird.

402
00:34:34.408 --> 00:34:38.412
Never seen anyone refuse
to see Lord Kim Jong-seo.

403
00:34:40.163 --> 00:34:43.500
Did you say
Lord Kim Jong-seo?

404
00:34:44.293 --> 00:34:45.377
Indeed.

405
00:34:45.878 --> 00:34:48.881
He was curious
about you.

406
00:34:49.214 --> 00:34:50.674
But since you’re too busy...

407
00:34:50.674 --> 00:34:52.885
Wait, wait!

408
00:34:53.135 --> 00:34:57.472
It’s part of our job
to get into trouble.

409
00:34:58.015 --> 00:35:01.518
It’s what happens
when we tell the truth.

410
00:35:01.768 --> 00:35:03.437
It happens quite often.

411
00:35:03.437 --> 00:35:06.565
- All the time.
- Every time.

412
00:35:06.565 --> 00:35:07.608
Let’s go.

413
00:35:08.066 --> 00:35:10.068
Where is he?

414
00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:30.506
Is he the one who caught
the murderer by reading faces?

415
00:35:30.964 --> 00:35:33.383
His name is
Kim Nae-kyeong.

416
00:35:41.767 --> 00:35:43.018
Bold.

417
00:35:43.393 --> 00:35:44.394
Stubborn.

418
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:45.812
Principled.

419
00:35:46.897 --> 00:35:48.607
He’s exactly as they say.

420
00:35:49.358 --> 00:35:51.151
What a remarkable face!

421
00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.614
A face of a tiger.

422
00:35:56.782 --> 00:35:59.701
Why are you
staring at me?

423
00:36:00.452 --> 00:36:02.160
Do I have a good face?

424
00:36:05.582 --> 00:36:06.750
Yes.

425
00:36:08.502 --> 00:36:12.339
You’ve got a distinguished face
as people say.

426
00:36:14.049 --> 00:36:16.927
Do they say
I look like a tiger?

427
00:36:19.972 --> 00:36:21.306
Yes.

428
00:36:22.474 --> 00:36:27.187
You’re brave and strong
like a tiger.

429
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.567
You’re a tiger.

430
00:36:31.567 --> 00:36:33.318
A tiger himself.

431
00:36:37.281 --> 00:36:40.367
He asked you to hire people
at the Inspection Board?

432
00:36:40.367 --> 00:36:41.577
Yes.

433
00:36:41.577 --> 00:36:44.037
So you’re an official now?

434
00:36:45.038 --> 00:36:49.960
It’s not really a job since
I’m just there to give advice.

435
00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.920
But it’s pretty
important work.

436
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.630
You’re an official!

437
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.215
Don’t laugh!
People will talk.

438
00:36:55.215 --> 00:36:56.550
Act calm.

439
00:37:00.053 --> 00:37:03.015
One has to be modest.

440
00:37:06.435 --> 00:37:09.021
Civil service, here.
Military service, there.

441
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:16.653
Human face is the embodiment
of nature and its order.

442
00:37:16.653 --> 00:37:19.615
Head shall be round
like the sky.

443
00:37:19.615 --> 00:37:23.202
Eyes shall shine like the sun
and the moon.

444
00:37:23.327 --> 00:37:25.204
Mouth is the sea,
philtrum is the river.

445
00:37:25.204 --> 00:37:27.039
It should be
long and impressive.

446
00:37:27.039 --> 00:37:31.627
Nose, cheekbones, and chin
shall be high like mountains.

447
00:37:31.627 --> 00:37:37.007
Hair must be fine and abundant
like trees and grass.

448
00:37:37.299 --> 00:37:40.135
If you take these
into account,

449
00:37:40.135 --> 00:37:42.888
you won’t make
huge mistakes.

450
00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.767
This candidate is handsome
and is from a good family.

451
00:37:46.767 --> 00:37:47.893
I’d like to hire him.

452
00:37:49.853 --> 00:37:53.273
How many times do
I have to tell you?

453
00:37:53.565 --> 00:37:56.527
Scribes need to record
all the time.

454
00:37:56.527 --> 00:37:59.321
It’s not good to change
scribes often.

455
00:37:59.321 --> 00:38:02.280
But this one likes to drink.

456
00:38:02.449 --> 00:38:04.743
He might develop
dementia later.

457
00:38:04.743 --> 00:38:09.581
Also, he’s unstable and
likes to change jobs often.

458
00:38:11.208 --> 00:38:13.252
Are you the
candidate’s cousin?

459
00:38:13.544 --> 00:38:16.713
Does he like to drink?

460
00:38:17.381 --> 00:38:22.135
Yes, he drinks like a fish
and then some.

461
00:38:23.136 --> 00:38:27.140
You should hire him
as a wine taster.

462
00:38:33.438 --> 00:38:34.857
Who’s that?

463
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:37.943
Why do you ask?

464
00:38:38.151 --> 00:38:41.029
- He looks...
- What?

465
00:38:41.029 --> 00:38:43.407
Rotten, completely.

466
00:38:49.454 --> 00:38:51.456
52 bags of whole grain.

467
00:38:51.456 --> 00:38:53.292
43 bags of refined grain.

468
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:58.881
34 rolls of silk
and 40 ounces of silver.

469
00:38:58.881 --> 00:39:01.049
He gathered
all these illegally?

470
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.803
How did you know?
He looked so naïve.

471
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:09.600
His eyes are charming,
but his mouth is sly.

472
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.934
That’s a bad sign.

473
00:39:11.685 --> 00:39:14.479
He’d have ripped off everything
if I had not caught him.

474
00:39:16.523 --> 00:39:22.029
Isn’t she the one
who had men troubles?

475
00:39:22.029 --> 00:39:28.243
After you put watermelon seed on her,
she’s been the talk of the town.

476
00:39:28.952 --> 00:39:32.080
What? She still keeps
the seed on the face?

477
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:39.421
No, Yeon-hong made her
a mole with pig blood.

478
00:39:39.922 --> 00:39:45.093
Amazing.
Changing one’s fate, huh?

479
00:39:45.886 --> 00:39:47.137
Please change mine, too.

480
00:39:48.472 --> 00:39:51.725
This isn’t gonna work.

481
00:39:52.851 --> 00:39:55.771
He’ll come soon.
Wait here.

482
00:39:55.771 --> 00:39:57.064
What’s this?

483
00:39:57.064 --> 00:39:58.065
It’s precious ginseng.

484
00:39:58.065 --> 00:40:01.652
- Ginseng?
- Yes.

485
00:40:01.652 --> 00:40:06.657
Come to the front.

486
00:40:07.324 --> 00:40:09.284
Please line up straight.

487
00:40:10.077 --> 00:40:11.411
What’s this?

488
00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:12.496
Dried persimmons.

489
00:40:12.496 --> 00:40:13.997
You need to wait.

490
00:40:14.081 --> 00:40:16.333
Put them here.

491
00:40:18.043 --> 00:40:22.381
Why are you on the line?

492
00:40:22.381 --> 00:40:24.591
You’re funny.

493
00:40:24.591 --> 00:40:28.053
They’re all here to see you.

494
00:40:28.387 --> 00:40:33.350
They want you to read faces and
pick out corrupted officials.

495
00:40:33.725 --> 00:40:36.270
Look what they brought.
Black peppers and ice!

496
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:38.522
That’s cold!

497
00:40:39.857 --> 00:40:41.066
Mr. Kim!

498
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.402
Don’t look surprised.

499
00:40:44.194 --> 00:40:46.822
Ice and peppers
are silly.

500
00:40:46.822 --> 00:40:48.615
Why are you
on the line?

501
00:40:49.324 --> 00:40:56.290
I’m here to see the greatest
face reader called Mr. Kim.

502
00:40:59.126 --> 00:41:00.294
Follow me.

503
00:41:00.294 --> 00:41:01.962
Where are we going?

504
00:41:01.962 --> 00:41:06.717
I have prepared a nice
place for you near here.

505
00:41:06.717 --> 00:41:08.466
You should come.

506
00:41:08.927 --> 00:41:10.721
I also prepared
a palanquin.

507
00:41:11.096 --> 00:41:12.556
A palanquin?

508
00:41:13.182 --> 00:41:15.142
We’re partners,
aren’t we?

509
00:41:15.267 --> 00:41:17.060
Paeng-heon.

510
00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.313
Don’t you feel like we’re
walking on the cloud?

511
00:41:19.313 --> 00:41:24.526
I feel like
the world is mine.

512
00:41:24.526 --> 00:41:27.446
Do you want a ride?

513
00:41:29.239 --> 00:41:32.367
Maybe next time?

514
00:41:36.955 --> 00:41:43.212
Is it my fault that there are
so many corrupted officials?

515
00:41:48.383 --> 00:41:51.845
There were always
corrupted officials

516
00:41:51.845 --> 00:41:55.933
under any king,
Your Majesty.

517
00:41:55.933 --> 00:42:00.187
But why so many now?

518
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:06.944
I hired an amazing face reader
as an inspector, Your Majesty.

519
00:42:08.445 --> 00:42:13.825
He’s at the Inspection Board.

520
00:42:14.368 --> 00:42:18.956
He’s excellent at finding people
who’s got anything to hide.

521
00:42:32.678 --> 00:42:36.390
I am Your Majesty’s

522
00:42:37.516 --> 00:42:40.018
most humble and
obedient servant.

523
00:42:46.024 --> 00:42:47.818
You can

524
00:42:48.443 --> 00:42:51.196
see through people?

525
00:42:56.535 --> 00:43:01.290
I don’t intend to.
It’s just...

526
00:43:02.958 --> 00:43:05.460
my humble talent.

527
00:43:24.938 --> 00:43:27.274
That’s very intriguing.

528
00:43:27.274 --> 00:43:28.275
However,

529
00:43:28.275 --> 00:43:32.821
despite being able to
read people’s past,

530
00:43:33.864 --> 00:43:37.659
you probably can’t read
the future, right?

531
00:43:38.452 --> 00:43:41.496
Isn’t that for the gods?

532
00:43:45.834 --> 00:43:47.961
Actually...

533
00:43:48.879 --> 00:43:53.008
if you take a good look
at the past,

534
00:43:53.008 --> 00:43:57.930
you can predict the future
quite accurately.

535
00:43:58.847 --> 00:44:00.807
Of course, you can’t
know everything

536
00:44:00.807 --> 00:44:03.644
- but the general direction...
- Nonsense!

537
00:44:07.606 --> 00:44:11.944
You should use your skill
to encourage people,

538
00:44:12.444 --> 00:44:15.364
not to make them worry.

539
00:44:15.739 --> 00:44:18.534
If that’s the case,
you better shut your mouth.

540
00:44:18.534 --> 00:44:20.827
I’ll keep
a close eye on you.

541
00:44:21.245 --> 00:44:26.124
If I see anything suspicious,
you will be removed.

542
00:44:36.093 --> 00:44:40.222
Did I do anything wrong?

543
00:44:40.806 --> 00:44:43.684
Why is he angry at me?

544
00:44:45.686 --> 00:44:47.855
He’s the one who
wanted to see me.

545
00:44:48.438 --> 00:44:50.691
Where did he
get this mutt?

546
00:44:51.358 --> 00:44:55.279
He’s out now.
He’ll be late.

547
00:44:55.279 --> 00:44:56.694
Come back tomorrow.

548
00:44:57.114 --> 00:44:59.074
Who do you think
you’re talking to?

549
00:44:59.324 --> 00:45:00.617
What’s going on?

550
00:45:01.034 --> 00:45:02.744
Don’t mind here.

551
00:45:03.287 --> 00:45:06.373
If you come late
at night like this

552
00:45:06.373 --> 00:45:11.253
you gotta bring
something, you know.

553
00:45:12.379 --> 00:45:16.133
Bring something tomorrow

554
00:45:16.884 --> 00:45:18.051
other than those swords.

555
00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:33.025
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!

556
00:45:37.905 --> 00:45:40.991
Come on,
are you kidding me?

557
00:45:40.991 --> 00:45:42.284
You’re the king?

558
00:45:44.077 --> 00:45:47.539
- Hey, hey.
- The king!

559
00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:51.418
The king.

560
00:46:02.012 --> 00:46:06.600
I came here unofficially

561
00:46:06.808 --> 00:46:12.064
because I don’t want
this in the record.

562
00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:18.362
Some people want to
take over the throne.

563
00:46:20.155 --> 00:46:23.408
Figure out who they are

564
00:46:24.284 --> 00:46:28.830
so I can prepare
for a possible coup.

565
00:46:31.708 --> 00:46:33.418
My king!

566
00:46:33.418 --> 00:46:36.797
I’ve never seen the faces
of important men.

567
00:46:37.464 --> 00:46:38.632
I’m not fit for...

568
00:46:38.632 --> 00:46:43.804
Find those who are
willing to step on others

569
00:46:43.804 --> 00:46:47.808
and those who are willing to
kill for what they want.

570
00:46:49.059 --> 00:46:51.895
As my condition gets worse

571
00:46:51.895 --> 00:46:54.857
it’s hard to tell what’s going to
happen in the future.

572
00:46:55.482 --> 00:46:57.943
I want to depend on you.

573
00:46:58.402 --> 00:47:02.614
You can disguise as my attendant
and look at those people.

574
00:47:02.614 --> 00:47:07.995
It’s best to look at them at
places they’re familiar with.

575
00:47:09.663 --> 00:47:13.584
Do you have
any good ideas?

576
00:47:23.093 --> 00:47:26.722
The man who killed his
brothers to become a king.

577
00:47:27.514 --> 00:47:29.725
Lee Bang-won.

578
00:47:29.725 --> 00:47:31.727
A traitor’s face.

579
00:47:39.484 --> 00:47:44.656
You think he’ll reward us
when you succeed?

580
00:47:44.907 --> 00:47:45.908
What?

581
00:47:46.158 --> 00:47:50.579
The king appointed
you personally!

582
00:47:50.787 --> 00:47:53.081
I think he’ll give you
an important position.

583
00:47:54.666 --> 00:47:56.126
Yes, yes.

584
00:47:57.002 --> 00:48:00.088
Wasn’t sure
what to make of it,

585
00:48:00.088 --> 00:48:04.510
but my time has come,
this is it.

586
00:48:05.677 --> 00:48:07.095
Is that so?

587
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:11.600
- Lord Nae-kyeong!
- Hey, stop it.

588
00:48:14.311 --> 00:48:16.271
What?

589
00:48:22.528 --> 00:48:25.864
His Majesty bestowed this
painting upon me?

590
00:48:25.864 --> 00:48:29.284
The first one I read was
Premier Hwang Bo-in.

591
00:48:30.744 --> 00:48:34.540
He’s a typical nobleman.

592
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:39.837
He’s lazy and is happy
with the status quo.

593
00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.464
How about my brother
An-pyeong?

594
00:48:43.006 --> 00:48:44.675
Prince An-pyeong.

595
00:48:44.675 --> 00:48:46.468
An honest man.

596
00:48:46.885 --> 00:48:48.637
Excellent eye for beauty.

597
00:48:50.055 --> 00:48:54.184
He doesn’t consider
his noble birth special.

598
00:48:54.184 --> 00:48:58.313
He’s too delicate
to become a killer.

599
00:49:02.442 --> 00:49:07.239
When he saw bugs, he drew them
instead of killing.

600
00:49:07.656 --> 00:49:10.409
Shin Suk-ju is
a very smart man.

601
00:49:10.701 --> 00:49:14.329
He has reached
his position easily.

602
00:49:15.247 --> 00:49:16.915
That’s why he’s
more interested in

603
00:49:16.915 --> 00:49:19.710
women than power.

604
00:49:24.047 --> 00:49:29.845
You will read
Prince Su-yang next.

605
00:49:31.513 --> 00:49:35.517
He’s the most ambitious one
among my brothers.

606
00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:42.441
Please look into his soul.

607
00:50:13.263 --> 00:50:15.390
He gave me a painting?

608
00:50:25.234 --> 00:50:27.444
Is he Prince Su-yang?

609
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.471
He’s afraid of you.

610
00:50:54.471 --> 00:50:58.058
He doesn’t have the guts
to steal the throne.

611
00:50:58.058 --> 00:51:00.686
He is easily pleased
with small things.

612
00:51:00.686 --> 00:51:03.981
Your Majesty has nothing
to worry about.

613
00:51:05.232 --> 00:51:06.525
You sure?

614
00:51:06.942 --> 00:51:08.735
I’m sure.

615
00:51:16.869 --> 00:51:18.829
Do you have children?

616
00:51:19.288 --> 00:51:21.081
I have a son.

617
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:24.585
It doesn’t matter
when I die.

618
00:51:24.585 --> 00:51:27.504
But I worry about
the Crown Prince.

619
00:51:27.504 --> 00:51:32.676
How would that young thing
survive in this menacing world?

620
00:51:34.219 --> 00:51:36.346
I cannot fathom.

621
00:51:53.572 --> 00:51:55.699
They’ve passed
the state exam.

622
00:51:55.699 --> 00:51:56.408
I see.

623
00:52:08.545 --> 00:52:11.173
Do you know him?

624
00:52:12.132 --> 00:52:13.467
No.

625
00:52:14.468 --> 00:52:16.887
He looked familiar.

626
00:52:17.429 --> 00:52:19.515
It’s nothing.

627
00:52:20.432 --> 00:52:23.268
He changed his name.

628
00:52:25.687 --> 00:52:27.397
Let me ask
you a question.

629
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:32.986
You got the highest score.
What was the hardest task?

630
00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.582
It was not giving in
to destiny.

631
00:52:56.677 --> 00:52:58.512
Father!

632
00:52:59.137 --> 00:53:01.849
Destiny? Give in?

633
00:53:03.767 --> 00:53:05.644
I won’t allow this.

634
00:53:05.936 --> 00:53:08.313
I told you
I’ll become an official.

635
00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:13.110
I couldn’t use my name
so I borrowed other’s.

636
00:53:15.487 --> 00:53:18.824
But, why are you here?

637
00:53:18.824 --> 00:53:21.785
Because
Lord Kim Jong-seo...

638
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.956
It’s not the point.
That’s not the point, is it?

639
00:53:29.126 --> 00:53:32.212
You already sensed
he took the top place?

640
00:53:43.265 --> 00:53:45.100
I’m sorry, father.

641
00:53:51.231 --> 00:53:52.858
Alright, go.

642
00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.403
Pardon?

643
00:53:57.112 --> 00:54:02.534
Since you took the job,
do your best.

644
00:54:12.044 --> 00:54:13.962
I knew it!

645
00:54:15.005 --> 00:54:17.925
I knew he’d pass.

646
00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:21.011
He could become
a minister!

647
00:54:21.011 --> 00:54:22.888
Nonsense.

648
00:54:23.847 --> 00:54:26.767
Right now he has
a small position,

649
00:54:26.767 --> 00:54:28.810
but if he keeps lying

650
00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:32.105
it’ll be hard to become
even a small town official.

651
00:54:38.529 --> 00:54:40.489
Are you Kim Nae-kyeong?

652
00:54:41.031 --> 00:54:42.783
Yes?

653
00:54:43.408 --> 00:54:47.120
The king left
a special order for you.

654
00:54:48.247 --> 00:54:51.041
Kim Nae-kyeong,

655
00:54:51.041 --> 00:54:52.626
accept the king’s letter.

656
00:55:03.929 --> 00:55:07.891
Your Majesty!

657
00:55:09.393 --> 00:55:14.314
By the time you read this,
I will be in the afterlife.

658
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:21.613
It is painful to think that
my son will be alone.

659
00:55:23.198 --> 00:55:26.910
It’ll be hard for him to
hold on to his throne alone.

660
00:55:27.452 --> 00:55:30.372
I want you and Kim Jong-seo
to help him.

661
00:55:31.331 --> 00:55:37.171
You know what it is like
to have a son.

662
00:55:37.754 --> 00:55:44.428
Please treat my son
like your own.

663
00:56:03.113 --> 00:56:06.617
His Majesty knew
all along.

664
00:56:06.617 --> 00:56:12.706
But nobody had
the face of a traitor.

665
00:56:15.918 --> 00:56:18.086
How about Su-yang?

666
00:56:19.796 --> 00:56:22.591
The king had ordered me
to inspect him closely.

667
00:56:22.591 --> 00:56:26.720
And since he’s your enemy,
I paid more attention.

668
00:56:27.221 --> 00:56:30.057
But he was of
no importance.

669
00:56:30.474 --> 00:56:32.184
Nonsense!

670
00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:37.689
I may know nothing,
but he’s got a look of a traitor.

671
00:56:38.982 --> 00:56:39.983
What?

672
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.445
Follow me.
Check it out yourself.

673
00:56:54.206 --> 00:56:57.251
Prince Su-yang is coming!

674
00:58:04.401 --> 00:58:10.699
Find those who are
willing to step on others

675
00:58:10.699 --> 00:58:16.580
and those who are willing to
kill for what they want.

676
00:58:21.126 --> 00:58:23.754
He’s a vicious wolf.

677
00:58:24.087 --> 00:58:27.382
He will rip your throat out.

678
00:58:27.966 --> 00:58:29.551
He has

679
00:58:33.055 --> 00:58:35.224
a traitor’s face.

680
00:58:37.518 --> 00:58:39.937
Hunting during a wake?

681
00:58:40.562 --> 00:58:43.232
People won’t take it kindly.

682
00:58:43.815 --> 00:58:47.277
It was just an archery practice
with friends.

683
00:58:47.277 --> 00:58:49.821
Don’t fret over it.

684
00:58:52.032 --> 00:58:57.246
Who’s that with you?

685
00:58:58.622 --> 00:59:01.458
He’s my aide.

686
00:59:04.253 --> 00:59:09.550
Aren’t you
the famous face reader?

687
00:59:16.473 --> 00:59:18.517
My instinct’s right!

688
00:59:18.517 --> 00:59:20.853
Lord, you believe
in face reading

689
00:59:20.853 --> 00:59:23.397
like the late king?

690
00:59:23.397 --> 00:59:26.441
What can you say
about my face?

691
00:59:28.068 --> 00:59:33.365
My grandma used to say
I have handsome ears.

692
00:59:33.365 --> 00:59:35.534
Is that true?

693
00:59:38.954 --> 00:59:40.831
They’re perfect.

694
00:59:47.129 --> 00:59:51.341
I’m having a party soon.

695
00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:54.011
You should come.

696
00:59:59.349 --> 01:00:01.143
I was a fool.

697
01:00:02.394 --> 01:00:04.605
I read the wrong man.

698
01:00:05.731 --> 01:00:10.068
This man won’t be afraid
of blood for the throne.

699
01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.198
But how did they know
I was coming?

700
01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:27.419
Kim Nae-kyeong!

701
01:00:34.092 --> 01:00:36.303
Hey, face reader.

702
01:00:36.637 --> 01:00:38.472
How have you been?

703
01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:42.893
He could be a problem.
Kill him.

704
01:00:42.893 --> 01:00:47.606
Why don’t you
read my face too?

705
01:01:10.587 --> 01:01:13.215
Face reader Kim.

706
01:01:14.174 --> 01:01:17.386
You work hard
these days.

707
01:01:17.386 --> 01:01:19.429
Have you been
following me?

708
01:01:19.638 --> 01:01:21.473
You have
an interesting talent.

709
01:01:21.473 --> 01:01:24.434
I’ve warned
Su-yang about you.

710
01:01:25.018 --> 01:01:29.982
That’s how I got
you and your king fooled.

711
01:01:31.525 --> 01:01:33.151
I have an offer.

712
01:01:34.444 --> 01:01:37.531
Let us change
the world together.

713
01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.284
Nothing difficult.

714
01:01:40.284 --> 01:01:43.871
All you have to do is
tell this to the king.

715
01:01:45.706 --> 01:01:50.752
Late king had told you to
find a potential traitor and

716
01:01:50.752 --> 01:01:54.298
that person you found
was Kim Jong-seo.

717
01:01:54.298 --> 01:02:00.429
Tell him Kim is plotting for a coup
and he should be stopped.

718
01:02:00.596 --> 01:02:02.055
What say you?

719
01:02:03.515 --> 01:02:06.602
Get rid of Kim and put
Su-yang on the throne?

720
01:02:06.602 --> 01:02:09.229
Never in my life will I
help you commit treason.

721
01:02:09.897 --> 01:02:13.358
Do you think I’ll
kill you that easily?

722
01:02:13.942 --> 01:02:17.738
I’ll gouge your eyes out

723
01:02:17.738 --> 01:02:19.865
so you can’t read
faces anymore.

724
01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:22.576
Not only that.

725
01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:26.622
I’ll cut off both legs
of your brother-in-law.

726
01:02:26.622 --> 01:02:27.744
You devil!

727
01:02:27.664 --> 01:02:30.501
And I’ll find your
one and only son.

728
01:02:30.501 --> 01:02:37.216
I’ll find him
and butcher him.

729
01:02:41.386 --> 01:02:42.471
Don’t you dare!

730
01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:52.231
Mr. Kim Nae-kyeong,

731
01:02:53.899 --> 01:02:58.403
I know you want to
restore your family’s honor.

732
01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.240
If Su-yang becomes the king,

733
01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:06.995
your family will prosper
for generations to come.

734
01:03:07.412 --> 01:03:09.786
Chance of a lifetime.

735
01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:12.543
Think about it.

736
01:03:50.706 --> 01:03:53.083
They vetted you.

737
01:03:54.293 --> 01:04:00.757
They’ll find us
wherever we go.

738
01:04:05.262 --> 01:04:07.139
Let’s do as they say.

739
01:04:08.432 --> 01:04:12.144
I heard Su-yang is
very generous

740
01:04:12.144 --> 01:04:14.271
and loyal to his men.

741
01:04:15.564 --> 01:04:20.485
How can you ask so easily
to commit treason?

742
01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:24.156
Think about it!

743
01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:33.040
Think about your son,
Jin-hyeong.

744
01:04:35.626 --> 01:04:39.046
He’s hiding his name to
keep a small position.

745
01:04:40.756 --> 01:04:42.841
That kid could
become a minister!

746
01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:46.220
Isn’t success
what you wanted?

747
01:04:47.346 --> 01:04:49.223
This is the only way!

748
01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:54.269
Just think of Jin-hyeong.

749
01:05:33.851 --> 01:05:34.935
Who’s that?

750
01:05:36.895 --> 01:05:38.856
Why are you here?

751
01:05:39.273 --> 01:05:41.275
Vice Premier Kim
ordered us to come.

752
01:05:41.275 --> 01:05:44.820
He wants you to report
the number and names of

753
01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.071
every illegal soldier
you have.

754
01:05:46.697 --> 01:05:50.492
Tell him to focus on
educating the young king.

755
01:05:50.492 --> 01:05:52.786
What is
the point of this?

756
01:05:52.786 --> 01:05:55.122
These are all the
soldiers you have?

757
01:05:55.122 --> 01:06:00.085
Three’s more than enough
to hunt a cub.

758
01:06:02.379 --> 01:06:03.964
How dare you.

759
01:06:03.964 --> 01:06:05.757
That’s very rude.

760
01:06:35.704 --> 01:06:37.122
It’s a perfect shot.

761
01:06:37.122 --> 01:06:38.790
You hit the tiger!

762
01:06:39.124 --> 01:06:42.044
I thought
I saw something.

763
01:06:42.211 --> 01:06:45.130
It was a tiger
you caught earlier.

764
01:06:46.215 --> 01:06:49.384
Please let me catch it
next time?

765
01:06:49.384 --> 01:06:50.469
Of course!

766
01:06:52.513 --> 01:06:53.472
Wait!

767
01:06:53.472 --> 01:06:57.726
Let’s give this tiger to
Lord Kim as a present.

768
01:06:58.852 --> 01:07:00.979
Should I skin it first?

769
01:07:00.979 --> 01:07:02.940
Or cut the head first?

770
01:07:03.315 --> 01:07:06.026
That’s a hard question.

771
01:07:14.326 --> 01:07:15.702
My lord!

772
01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:17.955
Please be calm!

773
01:07:59.663 --> 01:08:02.165
You don’t have to hide.

774
01:08:02.165 --> 01:08:03.792
I knew you’d be here.

775
01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:07.379
Between
a tiger and a wolf.

776
01:08:07.963 --> 01:08:10.674
Haven’t made up
your mind yet?

777
01:08:10.674 --> 01:08:11.842
Why are you here?

778
01:08:13.343 --> 01:08:17.264
Every famous fortunetellers
and face readers are here.

779
01:08:17.264 --> 01:08:18.891
Of course I’m invited.

780
01:08:19.266 --> 01:08:21.894
People are so fast.

781
01:08:22.978 --> 01:08:26.773
They’re attracted to power
as moths are to light.

782
01:08:27.858 --> 01:08:30.611
Who would stay
with the young king?

783
01:08:31.403 --> 01:08:35.574
This looks exactly
like the palace.

784
01:09:22.579 --> 01:09:24.164
Now,

785
01:09:24.498 --> 01:09:26.667
shall we talk about
my fortune?

786
01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:32.506
You will be the new leader of
the eastern peninsula!

787
01:09:33.549 --> 01:09:37.177
Oh my king!

788
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:42.307
Please lead us
from ignorance!

789
01:09:48.438 --> 01:09:52.609
Your face’s five points
resemble the king’s mountain.

790
01:09:53.777 --> 01:09:55.195
Is that true?

791
01:09:57.322 --> 01:09:57.739
Pardon me?

792
01:10:01.618 --> 01:10:03.078
Of course.

793
01:10:17.009 --> 01:10:20.971
Your expression
says otherwise.

794
01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:25.601
Tell me the truth.

795
01:10:28.061 --> 01:10:30.939
- Your Highness...
- Tell me!

796
01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:36.528
Without a coup,
you won’t be able to

797
01:10:37.196 --> 01:10:39.489
become a king.

798
01:10:40.157 --> 01:10:42.159
Please don’t
commit treason.

799
01:10:42.159 --> 01:10:43.911
It’ll be a tragedy
for this country.

800
01:10:43.911 --> 01:10:48.332
This country is founded
by the Lees.

801
01:10:48.332 --> 01:10:51.793
Why is a Kim trying to
ruin everything?

802
01:10:53.629 --> 01:10:59.051
The old tiger you work for
could kill the young king.

803
01:11:07.351 --> 01:11:09.728
I know
you work for Kim.

804
01:11:35.379 --> 01:11:38.507
Oh, it’s you!

805
01:11:41.468 --> 01:11:43.262
I’m glad to see you.

806
01:11:43.262 --> 01:11:45.806
Things were
getting boring.

807
01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:48.934
Would you
read my face?

808
01:11:49.226 --> 01:11:52.813
Am I going to be the king?

809
01:11:55.107 --> 01:11:57.192
Tell me.

810
01:11:57.192 --> 01:11:59.736
Do I have a king’s face?

811
01:12:07.202 --> 01:12:09.162
Perhaps I have
odd features.

812
01:12:11.248 --> 01:12:14.751
Even the best face reader
can’t read my face.

813
01:12:16.211 --> 01:12:20.924
Make up
your mind quickly.

814
01:12:22.759 --> 01:12:27.890
Because it’ll be too late
when I’m already the king.

815
01:12:40.944 --> 01:12:44.740
You could’ve said
what he wanted.

816
01:12:45.782 --> 01:12:47.868
You could’ve been killed.

817
01:13:03.926 --> 01:13:06.053
Are you doing well?

818
01:13:07.179 --> 01:13:08.388
Huh?

819
01:13:09.014 --> 01:13:11.266
I know what it’s like.

820
01:13:13.268 --> 01:13:15.771
It’s difficult when
you first start.

821
01:13:17.606 --> 01:13:23.362
I’m happy when
I help people in need.

822
01:13:24.112 --> 01:13:26.865
If you hadn’t born
in our family,

823
01:13:27.449 --> 01:13:32.037
you could‘ve kept your name
and done much better.

824
01:13:32.746 --> 01:13:34.623
You don’t feel bitter?

825
01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.837
I do feel bitter.

826
01:13:44.424 --> 01:13:48.470
That’s why I investigated
grandfather’s case.

827
01:13:52.599 --> 01:13:55.018
He had committed
many crimes.

828
01:13:55.686 --> 01:13:57.771
Because of him,
many people died

829
01:13:57.771 --> 01:14:00.357
and the country
was harmed.

830
01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:09.032
But rather than
feeling bitter for myself,

831
01:14:09.825 --> 01:14:12.244
I decided to
focus on my work.

832
01:14:13.829 --> 01:14:20.836
Perhaps I’ll be able to
wash away some of his sins.

833
01:14:26.758 --> 01:14:28.260
Thank you.

834
01:14:30.554 --> 01:14:31.597
Huh?

835
01:14:39.855 --> 01:14:44.860
Your face look
a bit different.

836
01:14:46.862 --> 01:14:49.281
My eyes are weaker.

837
01:14:49.698 --> 01:14:52.659
I think it’s because I read
under dim light.

838
01:14:54.119 --> 01:14:56.872
Eyes are the window
to the soul.

839
01:14:57.998 --> 01:15:03.045
You have to watch out
your face changing in a bad way.

840
01:15:04.755 --> 01:15:05.631
Okay.

841
01:15:07.257 --> 01:15:10.719
I want to become
a proud father to you.

842
01:15:27.194 --> 01:15:29.738
I believe Su-yang is ready.

843
01:15:30.697 --> 01:15:34.826
If you face
a foe like him head-on,

844
01:15:34.826 --> 01:15:36.954
you will undoubtably lose.

845
01:15:36.954 --> 01:15:39.164
We have to start soon.

846
01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:41.291
When?

847
01:15:41.583 --> 01:15:45.629
I’ll do it tomorrow
after king’s banquet.

848
01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:47.297
Su-yang’s only weakness

849
01:15:47.297 --> 01:15:50.342
is having less experience
than you.

850
01:15:51.426 --> 01:15:56.139
But he has a secret schemer
who's very helpful to him.

851
01:15:56.139 --> 01:15:59.935
I have prepared a kid
who looks like him.

852
01:16:01.562 --> 01:16:03.897
The body of the real king

853
01:16:04.606 --> 01:16:11.446
will be cut into 300 parts
and dispersed in the mountains.

854
01:16:12.114 --> 01:16:15.242
Preemptive strike
is the only answer.

855
01:16:17.035 --> 01:16:18.996
That’s the only way.

856
01:16:26.378 --> 01:16:28.380
This is my father’s writing.

857
01:16:28.922 --> 01:16:30.716
My father had told you

858
01:16:30.716 --> 01:16:33.218
to find a traitor
by face reading?

859
01:16:34.803 --> 01:16:39.141
Isn’t this Prince Su-yang?

860
01:16:39.141 --> 01:16:43.020
Please look at that portrait
of King Taejong.

861
01:16:44.521 --> 01:16:49.443
Doesn’t Su-yang
look like him?

862
01:16:50.402 --> 01:16:52.738
What are you implying?

863
01:16:53.906 --> 01:16:56.950
Are you telling me just like
my great-grandfather,

864
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:59.161
my uncle will
take the throne?

865
01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.914
Your Majesty.

866
01:17:01.914 --> 01:17:04.082
Take a look at
Su-yang’s face.

867
01:17:04.082 --> 01:17:10.797
He has his grandfather’s
strong desire for power.

868
01:17:11.048 --> 01:17:14.718
Face reading is
a trivial matter.

869
01:17:14.968 --> 01:17:17.221
My father really
believed in this?

870
01:17:18.263 --> 01:17:19.431
Your Majesty.

871
01:17:20.641 --> 01:17:24.937
Lord Kim, are you
that afraid of Su-yang?

872
01:17:24.937 --> 01:17:27.147
It’s not a matter of
being afraid.

873
01:17:27.147 --> 01:17:29.441
The whole country’s
at stake.

874
01:17:29.858 --> 01:17:32.444
We’re not just telling you
based on face reading.

875
01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:36.573
People can’t stop talking about
Su-yang’s atrocious acts.

876
01:17:36.573 --> 01:17:39.910
You have to stop
him immediately.

877
01:17:43.956 --> 01:17:48.126
My pawn is
threatening your king.

878
01:17:52.214 --> 01:17:54.758
Nine o’clock!

879
01:18:03.934 --> 01:18:07.187
You’re leaving early for
China tomorrow.

880
01:18:07.604 --> 01:18:08.605
Should we stop?

881
01:18:09.606 --> 01:18:13.569
It’ll be like a tour,
don’t you worry.

882
01:18:17.155 --> 01:18:20.659
Excuse me while
I use the restroom.

883
01:18:33.547 --> 01:18:37.301
Stick it in
under the ear lobe.

884
01:18:39.219 --> 01:18:42.514
Don’t soil your hands, Prince.
I'll Do it.

885
01:19:40.239 --> 01:19:43.951
Today Vice Premier Kim
and Nae-kyeong came.

886
01:19:46.036 --> 01:19:52.376
They told me that you’re
trying to dethrone me.

887
01:19:54.002 --> 01:19:56.088
Who can predict
the future?

888
01:19:56.713 --> 01:20:00.425
They only know how
to read faces.

889
01:20:01.385 --> 01:20:03.595
They don’t know
what’s underneath.

890
01:20:03.595 --> 01:20:06.515
Nobody knows
what’s underneath.

891
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:10.018
Don’t listen to them.

892
01:20:10.602 --> 01:20:12.604
I don’t want to.

893
01:20:13.689 --> 01:20:19.736
I remember the friendly
uncle who took care of me.

894
01:20:21.113 --> 01:20:25.784
I want to remember
you like that.

895
01:20:26.326 --> 01:20:29.621
If it is my destiny to
commit treason,

896
01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:38.881
I will change it
with my free will.

897
01:20:55.397 --> 01:20:56.815
What is it?

898
01:20:57.566 --> 01:21:00.611
There was an order to
switch at nine o’clock.

899
01:21:00.611 --> 01:21:02.779
- From whom?
- Vice Premier Kim.

900
01:21:02.779 --> 01:21:05.574
Since when is he
in charge of security?

901
01:21:05.782 --> 01:21:08.035
I asked him to do it.

902
01:21:08.785 --> 01:21:13.916
I thought the guards would be
tired without a shift change.

903
01:21:15.918 --> 01:21:20.881
Please excuse me.

904
01:21:36.313 --> 01:21:38.440
A traitor’s face.

905
01:21:56.959 --> 01:21:58.460
Before Su-yang
leaves for China,

906
01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:01.463
his soldiers were on standby
near the palace.

907
01:22:01.797 --> 01:22:05.467
He was with the king
until late.

908
01:22:06.677 --> 01:22:09.221
And I found this poison needle
while searching the floor.

909
01:22:09.972 --> 01:22:13.934
This poison kills the victim
by inducing a 10-day fever.

910
01:22:13.934 --> 01:22:18.480
He may be trying to divert
the suspicion while he’s in China.

911
01:22:18.814 --> 01:22:21.859
He’s getting bold.

912
01:22:22.109 --> 01:22:24.862
It must be
that schemer’s idea.

913
01:22:24.862 --> 01:22:28.156
We have to catch him
while Su-yang’s away.

914
01:22:28.615 --> 01:22:32.369
But how? You said
you only know his voice.

915
01:22:32.369 --> 01:22:34.621
Give me
some of your men.

916
01:22:34.621 --> 01:22:37.749
I’ll comb through the city
if needed.

917
01:22:38.584 --> 01:22:42.880
There are 3 suspicious figures
under Su-yang.

918
01:22:43.172 --> 01:22:49.887
Ahn Kyeong-son is
Su-yang’s personal guard.

919
01:22:50.554 --> 01:22:55.100
Lee Mong-ga, a love child
of a court scholar,

920
01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:59.646
staying day and night
at courtesan houses.

921
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:05.485
Finally, a former royal guard,
whose details aren’t clear.

922
01:23:05.485 --> 01:23:07.529
He quit a long time ago.

923
01:23:07.905 --> 01:23:10.282
Never visited again.

924
01:23:11.033 --> 01:23:14.620
But why look for
the neck cripple?

925
01:23:14.912 --> 01:23:17.289
Has he done
something?

926
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:21.001
Neck cripple?

927
01:23:21.168 --> 01:23:22.998
He always does like this.

928
01:23:26.131 --> 01:23:27.716
What’s his name?

929
01:23:28.008 --> 01:23:29.801
His name is
Han Myeong-hwoe.

930
01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:33.555
Han Myeong-hwoe.

931
01:23:36.767 --> 01:23:38.810
The prince’s not here.
Get out!

932
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:41.188
The schemer’s name is
Han Myeong-hwoe.

933
01:23:41.188 --> 01:23:44.024
He’s been helping
Su-yang for two years.

934
01:23:44.525 --> 01:23:49.404
Except for Su-yang,
not many have seen his face.

935
01:23:49.738 --> 01:23:53.283
I may be able to find him
by his voice alone.

936
01:23:56.578 --> 01:23:59.414
So much garbage here!

937
01:23:59.414 --> 01:24:01.792
Who’s Han Myeong-hwoe?

938
01:24:01.792 --> 01:24:03.627
There’s no such person!

939
01:24:03.627 --> 01:24:06.088
Find him if you can!

940
01:24:19.017 --> 01:24:20.727
Say something.

941
01:24:21.687 --> 01:24:22.604
Like what?

942
01:24:23.021 --> 01:24:24.147
Like a cry?

943
01:24:24.147 --> 01:24:25.607
‘Did someone die?’

944
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:28.151
Maybe a chicken cry?

945
01:24:34.741 --> 01:24:37.494
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

946
01:24:52.551 --> 01:24:58.432
The king is angry for causing
a scene at Su-yang’s home.

947
01:24:58.932 --> 01:25:03.979
When I heard he was reading
a book on face reading,

948
01:25:03.979 --> 01:25:06.481
I thought
there was hope.

949
01:25:06.899 --> 01:25:11.987
But now he has sent all
the doctors to Su-yang

950
01:25:11.987 --> 01:25:14.740
because he got sick
on the road.

951
01:25:14.907 --> 01:25:19.411
Blood is thicker
than water, indeed.

952
01:25:20.662 --> 01:25:22.331
Lord.

953
01:25:24.625 --> 01:25:26.543
What did you just say?

954
01:25:26.543 --> 01:25:29.463
Su-yang contracted
a disease in China

955
01:25:29.463 --> 01:25:31.924
but it’s nothing serious.

956
01:25:32.341 --> 01:25:34.927
The king is reading a book
on face reading?

957
01:25:37.429 --> 01:25:38.847
Yes.

958
01:25:56.990 --> 01:26:02.287
It’s the record of Han Dynasty,
when treasons prevailed.

959
01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.633
This is it!

960
01:26:24.643 --> 01:26:27.271
Fire! Fire!

961
01:26:36.655 --> 01:26:38.156
Fire!

962
01:26:39.575 --> 01:26:41.535
You must’ve been tired.

963
01:26:41.785 --> 01:26:44.371
We heard
your snoring from here.

964
01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:50.127
Snoring?

965
01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:53.797
Are you kidding me?

966
01:26:53.922 --> 01:27:00.762
I hear you can make
beautiful moles.

967
01:27:05.767 --> 01:27:08.604
You want me
to go with you

968
01:27:08.604 --> 01:27:12.524
and put a mole on
Su-yang’s face?

969
01:27:17.362 --> 01:27:20.866
You seriously think
I’d help you?

970
01:27:22.034 --> 01:27:23.410
Yes.

971
01:27:27.456 --> 01:27:29.244
You remember this?

972
01:27:30.918 --> 01:27:33.378
It’s our partnership contract.

973
01:27:34.838 --> 01:27:36.089
So what?

974
01:27:36.381 --> 01:27:41.053
If I get caught while
messing up Su-yang’s face,

975
01:27:41.553 --> 01:27:45.140
I could say my partner
ordered me to do it.

976
01:27:46.683 --> 01:27:48.393
What would happen then?

977
01:28:09.289 --> 01:28:11.416
Is it hot in here?

978
01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.216
Give it to me, you ass!

979
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:23.804
Please I beg you!

980
01:28:27.057 --> 01:28:30.102
What are they doing?

981
01:28:46.785 --> 01:28:50.831
Do you know
Vice Premier Kim?

982
01:28:51.248 --> 01:28:54.209
I respect him
very much.

983
01:28:54.209 --> 01:28:58.046
People with yellow tags are
hired because it means

984
01:28:58.046 --> 01:29:02.759
Kim Jong-seo
recommended them.

985
01:29:02.759 --> 01:29:09.808
You have to tell him to stop this
nonsense with yellow tags.

986
01:29:09.808 --> 01:29:14.646
If we do that, it’ll only
make Su-yang happy.

987
01:29:15.355 --> 01:29:20.694
It’s unavoidable
to stop Su-yang!

988
01:29:22.779 --> 01:29:25.741
The prince will be attended by
outside doctors.

989
01:29:25.741 --> 01:29:31.371
The royal physician
may leave now.

990
01:29:48.472 --> 01:29:49.515
Are you new?

991
01:29:50.057 --> 01:29:51.558
Yes.

992
01:30:02.277 --> 01:30:05.405
The security’s tight.

993
01:30:08.075 --> 01:30:11.161
You look perfect.
You fit the part.

994
01:30:13.247 --> 01:30:17.960
If this is my path to afterlife,
I’ll haunt you forever.

995
01:30:23.549 --> 01:30:24.925
Ouch!

996
01:30:49.283 --> 01:30:51.076
Once he inhales this,

997
01:30:51.076 --> 01:30:53.912
he’ll feel no pain and
remember nothing.

998
01:30:53.912 --> 01:30:56.665
But it’ll only last
for a short time.

999
01:30:56.665 --> 01:30:59.835
If we don’t finish until
this incense is burned,

1000
01:31:01.587 --> 01:31:05.257
we’ll all be killed.

1001
01:31:59.102 --> 01:32:00.979
Are you blind?

1002
01:32:05.526 --> 01:32:07.778
This part!

1003
01:33:30.903 --> 01:33:32.446
Hey, hey!

1004
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:36.783
- We’re finished!
- All done!

1005
01:34:10.442 --> 01:34:13.362
I almost died.

1006
01:34:14.613 --> 01:34:17.032
I had to pee so badly.

1007
01:34:17.616 --> 01:34:19.868
I can’t stop peeing.

1008
01:34:26.708 --> 01:34:31.713
I was raised in the courtesan house
since the age of 5.

1009
01:34:32.464 --> 01:34:35.759
Tiniest mistake could
lead to beatings,

1010
01:34:35.759 --> 01:34:41.056
so I learned how to
read people to survive.

1011
01:34:41.557 --> 01:34:46.270
That’s how I became the owner
of the biggest courtesan house.

1012
01:34:51.567 --> 01:34:53.944
You’re better
at face reading.

1013
01:34:53.944 --> 01:34:56.655
But I think I’m better
at reading people.

1014
01:34:57.489 --> 01:34:59.694
Do you think this will
stop the revolt?

1015
01:35:02.077 --> 01:35:03.370
It has to.

1016
01:35:08.292 --> 01:35:10.502
If it works out,
don’t forget me.

1017
01:35:11.879 --> 01:35:13.881
If it doesn’t,
forget me.

1018
01:35:23.724 --> 01:35:24.725
So...

1019
01:35:26.018 --> 01:35:27.019
Who is it?

1020
01:35:27.019 --> 01:35:30.439
Who wrote about the
Vice Premier’s yellow tag?

1021
01:35:35.194 --> 01:35:36.278
Alright.

1022
01:35:36.987 --> 01:35:40.699
Tell me more about it.

1023
01:35:43.785 --> 01:35:49.917
Earlier, I saw an official
tagging himself.

1024
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:56.256
Back when he was an inspector,
he extorted money from the locals

1025
01:35:58.550 --> 01:36:01.261
and stole people’s wives.

1026
01:36:02.221 --> 01:36:06.767
Yellow tag could be useful
if it’s used right,

1027
01:36:08.852 --> 01:36:11.355
but it also has
many problems.

1028
01:36:13.982 --> 01:36:21.156
I’m glad someone came forward
to tell me about this.

1029
01:36:23.408 --> 01:36:27.120
I believe
something must be done.

1030
01:36:30.582 --> 01:36:32.626
About Vice Premier Kim.

1031
01:36:33.585 --> 01:36:37.381
He recommends people
with yellow tags

1032
01:36:38.131 --> 01:36:42.386
and talks behind your back.

1033
01:36:42.678 --> 01:36:46.890
That’s because
you’re too nice to him.

1034
01:36:47.182 --> 01:36:49.351
My father trusted him.

1035
01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:51.562
That’s why I...

1036
01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.407
Are you okay?

1037
01:37:03.824 --> 01:37:05.200
It’s nothing.

1038
01:37:06.201 --> 01:37:10.747
The sun was too strong.

1039
01:37:19.339 --> 01:37:21.466
Qin Xi of Zhao State
took over the throne

1040
01:37:23.635 --> 01:37:25.429
by starting a coup,

1041
01:37:26.513 --> 01:37:30.225
after 3 moles appeared
on his forehead.

1042
01:37:30.726 --> 01:37:34.479
He has his grandfather’s
strong desire for power.

1043
01:37:34.479 --> 01:37:38.108
People can’t stop talking about
Su-yang’s atrocious acts.

1044
01:37:38.108 --> 01:37:40.861
Since when is he
in charge of security?

1045
01:37:49.703 --> 01:37:54.666
Who ordered you
to guard me?

1046
01:37:56.585 --> 01:37:58.045
It’s...

1047
01:37:58.462 --> 01:38:00.797
Tell me now.

1048
01:38:01.548 --> 01:38:05.719
Prince Su-yang
ordered me.

1049
01:38:13.435 --> 01:38:15.437
I was blind.

1050
01:38:16.063 --> 01:38:18.565
I’m surrounded by
Su-yang’s men.

1051
01:38:19.191 --> 01:38:21.610
I can’t let his men
watch over me.

1052
01:38:22.194 --> 01:38:23.320
Exile him.

1053
01:38:27.741 --> 01:38:31.119
We can’t make a mistake.

1054
01:38:31.828 --> 01:38:35.791
Tomorrow when Su-yang’s
men escort the Chinese envoy,

1055
01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:38.752
we will strike him.

1056
01:38:39.670 --> 01:38:43.257
He’s giving a reception to
the envoy right now.

1057
01:38:43.257 --> 01:38:47.922
Make sure
this does not leak.

1058
01:38:52.432 --> 01:38:54.393
Nae-kyeong, Nae-kyeong.

1059
01:38:54.768 --> 01:38:57.312
Will he give you
an important position?

1060
01:38:57.312 --> 01:39:00.315
Did he promise?

1061
01:39:02.943 --> 01:39:06.363
You didn’t even ask?

1062
01:39:06.363 --> 01:39:08.532
Of course you didn’t.

1063
01:39:09.783 --> 01:39:12.828
I’ll ask
when things die down.

1064
01:39:13.495 --> 01:39:18.500
I’m sure Lord Kim could
give Jin-hyeong a good position.

1065
01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:21.378
You have to ask
before you offer to help.

1066
01:39:21.378 --> 01:39:25.799
You never know what
might happen.

1067
01:39:27.009 --> 01:39:28.385
It’s ready.

1068
01:39:30.137 --> 01:39:31.680
Here.

1069
01:39:33.724 --> 01:39:35.434
Is this good for eyes?

1070
01:39:35.809 --> 01:39:37.853
I need mums from
that mountain.

1071
01:39:37.853 --> 01:39:39.938
They work the best.

1072
01:39:40.397 --> 01:39:44.151
But I hurt my back and
can’t climb the mountain.

1073
01:39:44.151 --> 01:39:48.238
So I used the next best thing.
It’ll work pretty well.

1074
01:39:49.364 --> 01:39:51.325
When will
your back improve?

1075
01:39:51.325 --> 01:39:54.244
After a couple of days.

1076
01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:01.376
What is this?

1077
01:40:04.671 --> 01:40:07.090
These are old matters.

1078
01:40:07.424 --> 01:40:10.052
You don’t have to
worry about it.

1079
01:40:10.052 --> 01:40:12.346
Say it now!

1080
01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:17.893
Who told the king about
the yellow tags?

1081
01:40:24.608 --> 01:40:27.069
Mr. Kim from the Inspection Board
left this for you.

1082
01:40:31.365 --> 01:40:32.741
Here.

1083
01:40:39.706 --> 01:40:42.292
I’m proud that
you were promoted.

1084
01:40:42.626 --> 01:40:45.170
Take this.
It’s good for your eyes.

1085
01:40:45.963 --> 01:40:51.677
It’d have been nice to see him
since we were there.

1086
01:40:52.052 --> 01:40:55.389
I didn’t want him to
feel uncomfortable.

1087
01:40:56.515 --> 01:40:59.351
I hope the medicine
works well.

1088
01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:01.353
Where are you going?

1089
01:41:01.937 --> 01:41:05.607
Going to get some mums.

1090
01:41:06.567 --> 01:41:08.861
I want the best for him.

1091
01:41:08.861 --> 01:41:11.697
Let’s go together.

1092
01:41:12.114 --> 01:41:13.740
No need.

1093
01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:57.326
How dare you talk about
the Vice Premier like that?

1094
01:41:57.618 --> 01:42:00.329
Kid, you know nothing.

1095
01:42:01.371 --> 01:42:05.918
You’ll shut your mouth
when you can’t see anything.

1096
01:42:15.093 --> 01:42:16.762
Is Mr. Kim here?

1097
01:42:17.638 --> 01:42:19.014
Mr. Kim?

1098
01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:24.228
He’s out...

1099
01:42:25.938 --> 01:42:26.855
What’s wrong?

1100
01:42:27.105 --> 01:42:30.192
A young man in Saganwon
hurt his eyes badly.

1101
01:42:30.692 --> 01:42:32.486
He wants to see Mr. Kim.

1102
01:42:32.486 --> 01:42:35.030
A young man
in Saganwon...

1103
01:42:36.073 --> 01:42:37.699
You mean Jin-hyeong?

1104
01:42:39.117 --> 01:42:41.036
Jin-hyeong hurt his eyes?

1105
01:42:45.999 --> 01:42:49.086
Right eye’s gone.

1106
01:42:49.086 --> 01:42:51.463
The left one’s bad too.

1107
01:42:52.047 --> 01:42:53.799
Will he lose his sight?

1108
01:42:53.799 --> 01:42:54.800
Yes.

1109
01:42:56.593 --> 01:42:58.512
Jin-hyeong!

1110
01:43:01.348 --> 01:43:03.183
What happened?

1111
01:43:04.184 --> 01:43:05.602
Uncle.

1112
01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:09.231
Yes, it’s me.
What happened?

1113
01:43:09.606 --> 01:43:13.235
Where’s father?
I want to see him.

1114
01:43:19.408 --> 01:43:23.078
Where are you, father!

1115
01:43:23.078 --> 01:43:24.371
Stay back!

1116
01:43:25.330 --> 01:43:27.791
Please.

1117
01:43:31.503 --> 01:43:36.210
Please fix his eyes!

1118
01:43:39.928 --> 01:43:42.431
What happened?

1119
01:43:42.431 --> 01:43:46.393
I heard
Kim Jong-seo ordered this.

1120
01:43:46.935 --> 01:43:50.981
He got pissed that kid told
the king about the yellow tags.

1121
01:43:50.981 --> 01:43:54.228
No way he’d harm
a kid like that!

1122
01:43:55.194 --> 01:43:58.488
I heard them talking.

1123
01:43:59.072 --> 01:44:02.326
They said
they were Kim’s men.

1124
01:44:02.868 --> 01:44:07.456
And Kim’ll put his grandson
in his position.

1125
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.126
Jin-hyeong.

1126
01:44:12.836 --> 01:44:17.799
Get up early tomorrow before
your father and leave for Hanyang.

1127
01:44:18.383 --> 01:44:19.635
What?

1128
01:44:20.219 --> 01:44:22.012
Go find
the peddler I know.

1129
01:44:22.012 --> 01:44:24.389
He’ll lend you
a new name.

1130
01:44:24.389 --> 01:44:28.018
Study hard and
get a job as you wish.

1131
01:44:33.815 --> 01:44:36.610
You can even become
a minister.

1132
01:44:37.694 --> 01:44:38.737
You know that?

1133
01:44:53.877 --> 01:44:54.753
Who’s there?

1134
01:45:03.595 --> 01:45:07.432
I came to see
Prince Su-yang.

1135
01:45:17.609 --> 01:45:20.320
Kim Nae-kyeong’s
brother-in-law is here.

1136
01:45:36.378 --> 01:45:38.630
Why are you here?

1137
01:45:40.549 --> 01:45:42.593
Don’t send your men
away tomorrow.

1138
01:45:44.511 --> 01:45:45.679
What?

1139
01:45:46.471 --> 01:45:52.102
Don’t escort
the Chinese envoy.

1140
01:45:52.936 --> 01:45:58.358
Kim Jong-seo will kill you
while your men are away.

1141
01:46:04.865 --> 01:46:07.409
Why are you
telling me this?

1142
01:46:08.410 --> 01:46:11.622
I heard you made
a promise to my brother.

1143
01:46:12.497 --> 01:46:14.917
Please...

1144
01:46:17.044 --> 01:46:19.838
Keep that promise.

1145
01:46:20.005 --> 01:46:22.758
Please restore
our family’s name

1146
01:46:22.758 --> 01:46:28.555
and offer a position
to my brother-in-law

1147
01:46:30.432 --> 01:46:33.477
and my nephew.

1148
01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:41.193
That’s all I ask.

1149
01:46:41.818 --> 01:46:43.320
Prince Su-yang.

1150
01:46:43.904 --> 01:46:46.782
Your highness, I beg you.

1151
01:46:58.168 --> 01:46:59.795
I promise.

1152
01:47:03.173 --> 01:47:04.758
I promise.

1153
01:47:34.413 --> 01:47:37.207
We’d have fallen
for their tricks.

1154
01:47:37.708 --> 01:47:41.170
How did you know he’d come
if that kid was hurt?

1155
01:47:41.795 --> 01:47:44.798
Who could’ve
predicted that?

1156
01:47:45.632 --> 01:47:48.552
I thought Kim Nae-kyeong
would come.

1157
01:47:59.229 --> 01:48:04.276
What did you just say?

1158
01:48:07.738 --> 01:48:11.658
I said all we have
to do is wait.

1159
01:48:12.618 --> 01:48:16.538
He will fix
Jin-hyeong’s eyes

1160
01:48:17.497 --> 01:48:19.917
and give him
a good post.

1161
01:48:48.695 --> 01:48:51.406
Wake up!

1162
01:48:53.534 --> 01:48:55.244
Kim Jong-seo...

1163
01:48:55.244 --> 01:48:59.289
He doesn’t care about
people like us.

1164
01:48:59.706 --> 01:49:05.587
He put his grandson
in Jin-hyeong’s place!

1165
01:49:17.349 --> 01:49:21.645
We’ll all die!

1166
01:49:22.396 --> 01:49:26.316
If Kim dies,
we’re all dead too!

1167
01:49:47.671 --> 01:49:51.341
I have to stop them.
Or everyone will perish!

1168
01:51:05.624 --> 01:51:07.292
Lord Kim!

1169
01:51:13.215 --> 01:51:15.259
Vice Premier.

1170
01:51:16.552 --> 01:51:18.554
Welcome.

1171
01:51:18.554 --> 01:51:22.349
We have much to discuss,
let’s go inside.

1172
01:51:22.683 --> 01:51:24.678
Vice Premier.

1173
01:51:28.063 --> 01:51:29.815
You have to run.

1174
01:51:29.815 --> 01:51:33.610
Run? What do you mean?

1175
01:51:39.867 --> 01:51:42.703
Where have you been?

1176
01:51:45.539 --> 01:51:47.916
Why are you here
at this hour?

1177
01:51:53.172 --> 01:51:56.633
I lost my hat string
on my way.

1178
01:51:57.384 --> 01:52:00.888
I was wondering if
I could borrow one.

1179
01:52:01.221 --> 01:52:06.435
I think you could survive
without a hat string for a night.

1180
01:52:06.685 --> 01:52:08.896
I need to go somewhere.

1181
01:52:09.521 --> 01:52:14.026
I don’t think they will like
my hat without a string.

1182
01:52:19.281 --> 01:52:21.116
Bring a hat string.

1183
01:52:41.136 --> 01:52:47.726
You look like you’d live
a long life till seventy.

1184
01:52:51.188 --> 01:52:53.148
How old are you?

1185
01:52:58.403 --> 01:53:00.614
Seventy this year.

1186
01:53:01.365 --> 01:53:05.911
I have a wish this year.

1187
01:53:13.794 --> 01:53:15.879
What is it?

1188
01:53:18.257 --> 01:53:20.467
To become a king.

1189
01:53:24.012 --> 01:53:26.390
What is this?!

1190
01:54:56.939 --> 01:54:59.191
Su-yang, you bastard!

1191
01:55:00.692 --> 01:55:03.529
Who do you think you are?

1192
01:55:40.732 --> 01:55:42.776
My lord!

1193
01:55:46.029 --> 01:55:48.407
The tiger hunt is over.

1194
01:55:59.084 --> 01:56:04.214
Su-yang killed
Kim Jong-seo!

1195
01:56:05.424 --> 01:56:08.010
Su-yang killed
Kim Jong-seo!

1196
01:56:14.224 --> 01:56:17.477
killed Kim Jong-seo!

1197
01:56:19.354 --> 01:56:24.610
Gather your men
and arrest Su-yang.

1198
01:56:24.610 --> 01:56:28.322
If we’re late
we can’t stop the revolt.

1199
01:56:28.697 --> 01:56:31.992
Who says that?
Who are you?

1200
01:56:35.162 --> 01:56:37.748
Who else?

1201
01:56:37.748 --> 01:56:41.627
It’s the famous
face reader.

1202
01:56:45.088 --> 01:56:47.799
Kim Nae-kyeong.

1203
01:56:47.799 --> 01:56:50.010
How have you been?

1204
01:56:51.762 --> 01:56:53.472
Han Myeong-hwoe.

1205
01:56:55.849 --> 01:57:02.105
You all committed treason...

1206
01:57:02.689 --> 01:57:04.399
All thanks to you.

1207
01:57:09.154 --> 01:57:11.031
You bastards!

1208
01:57:11.490 --> 01:57:13.492
You’ll be doomed.

1209
01:57:13.909 --> 01:57:15.994
Burn in hell!

1210
01:57:17.329 --> 01:57:20.249
I’ll show you
what hell is.

1211
01:57:24.545 --> 01:57:27.798
Premier Hwang Bo-in is here.

1212
01:57:29.508 --> 01:57:30.342
Who are you?

1213
01:57:30.342 --> 01:57:33.262
Have you enjoyed life?

1214
01:58:11.925 --> 01:58:15.470
Did you want me exiled?

1215
01:58:16.513 --> 01:58:21.018
If you have succeeded
I’d be dead by now.

1216
01:58:22.186 --> 01:58:24.771
That’s power.

1217
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:27.316
Either I die.

1218
01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:30.944
Or my enemy dies.

1219
01:58:32.487 --> 01:58:38.452
Three premiers have been killed
for manipulating the king.

1220
01:58:38.452 --> 01:58:42.372
From now on
I will control the premiers,

1221
01:58:42.372 --> 01:58:45.167
ministry of administration,
and ministry of justice.

1222
01:58:45.167 --> 01:58:49.171
I’ll also take control of
the army to protect the king.

1223
01:58:49.171 --> 01:58:52.549
If you support me,

1224
01:58:54.176 --> 01:58:56.178
line up here.

1225
01:58:56.803 --> 01:58:58.931
If you don’t,

1226
01:59:20.744 --> 01:59:27.501
We will not be able to
undo this atrocious act.

1227
01:59:28.502 --> 01:59:31.755
But I beg you.
Please be a good king

1228
01:59:32.381 --> 01:59:35.968
and rule
your subjects kindly.

1229
02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:27.811
I have to report
to the king

1230
02:00:27.811 --> 02:00:29.938
that I took care of
all his enemy.

1231
02:00:30.689 --> 02:00:32.733
You can go back now.

1232
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:43.827
Su-yang killed
Kim Jong-seo!

1233
02:00:44.244 --> 02:00:46.705
The world has changed!

1234
02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:51.502
He’s killing everyone
who’s against him.

1235
02:00:51.502 --> 02:00:54.838
All the officials are
being arrested.

1236
02:00:59.301 --> 02:01:01.254
Jin-hyeong...

1237
02:01:02.763 --> 02:01:08.060
These are
Su-yang’s enemies.

1238
02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:10.729
Everyone will be executed.

1239
02:01:10.729 --> 02:01:12.356
Walk straight!

1240
02:01:17.402 --> 02:01:18.820
Jin-hyeong!

1241
02:01:20.614 --> 02:01:21.740
Jin-hyeong!

1242
02:01:22.115 --> 02:01:23.242
Jin-hyeong!

1243
02:01:23.825 --> 02:01:25.285
Jin-hyeong!

1244
02:01:27.037 --> 02:01:28.163
It’s your father!

1245
02:01:28.163 --> 02:01:30.958
I’m here!
Jin-hyeong!

1246
02:01:31.708 --> 02:01:32.793
Nae-kyeong!

1247
02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:35.504
Nae-kyeong!

1248
02:01:35.671 --> 02:01:36.797
Jin-hyeong!

1249
02:01:44.221 --> 02:01:45.305
Jin-hyeong!

1250
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:49.810
Your highness!

1251
02:01:50.143 --> 02:01:51.895
Your highness!

1252
02:01:51.895 --> 02:01:53.564
Prince Su-yang!

1253
02:01:56.024 --> 02:01:57.651
Prince Su-yang!

1254
02:01:59.278 --> 02:02:00.279
please let him live!

1255
02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.866
That’s my son.
Please let him live.

1256
02:02:05.868 --> 02:02:07.619
Where is your son?

1257
02:02:07.619 --> 02:02:10.873
That one over there
is my son.

1258
02:02:10.873 --> 02:02:12.291
He’s just a kid.

1259
02:02:12.291 --> 02:02:15.002
Please save him,
your highness.

1260
02:02:20.924 --> 02:02:22.801
Jin-hyeong!

1261
02:02:22.801 --> 02:02:24.761
- Are you okay?
- Father?

1262
02:02:24.761 --> 02:02:26.054
Don’t worry.

1263
02:02:26.305 --> 02:02:27.306
Don’t worry.

1264
02:02:29.433 --> 02:02:30.642
Jin-hyeong.

1265
02:02:32.603 --> 02:02:34.396
Is he your son?

1266
02:02:34.855 --> 02:02:37.608
Yes, he is.

1267
02:02:37.608 --> 02:02:39.860
He was not on my side.

1268
02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:42.237
He’s an idiot.

1269
02:02:42.821 --> 02:02:44.198
He’s just a kid.

1270
02:02:44.656 --> 02:02:47.743
Then can I take
your eyes

1271
02:02:49.077 --> 02:02:52.247
for forgiving your son?

1272
02:02:53.665 --> 02:02:55.083
Yes, you can.

1273
02:02:55.709 --> 02:02:57.377
Please take my eyes!

1274
02:02:57.711 --> 02:03:00.172
Father, no!

1275
02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:02.090
Father!

1276
02:03:02.090 --> 02:03:03.258
You heard him.

1277
02:03:03.258 --> 02:03:06.136
Gouge out
his arrogant eyes!

1278
02:03:06.512 --> 02:03:08.388
No! Father, no!

1279
02:03:45.592 --> 02:03:47.386
Leave it that.

1280
02:03:47.386 --> 02:03:50.013
Why would
I need your eyes?

1281
02:04:04.736 --> 02:04:09.658
Instead, I want you
to read my face.

1282
02:04:18.166 --> 02:04:21.753
So, am I fit to be a king?

1283
02:04:23.797 --> 02:04:26.341
Still can’t tell?

1284
02:04:28.343 --> 02:04:29.887
No.

1285
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:31.805
No.

1286
02:04:33.307 --> 02:04:34.600
Your highness,

1287
02:04:35.309 --> 02:04:37.269
will become a king.

1288
02:04:38.312 --> 02:04:40.272
You will become
a great king

1289
02:04:40.272 --> 02:04:42.608
who will make
this country stronger.

1290
02:04:43.483 --> 02:04:46.111
You will go down in history

1291
02:04:46.111 --> 02:04:49.239
as the greatest king,
your highness!

1292
02:04:59.499 --> 02:05:03.712
That makes me
feel good.

1293
02:05:05.714 --> 02:05:07.674
Let’s finish here.

1294
02:05:08.509 --> 02:05:09.801
Go now.

1295
02:05:15.224 --> 02:05:17.726
Are you okay, father?

1296
02:05:18.101 --> 02:05:20.979
It’s okay, Jin-hyeong.

1297
02:05:25.692 --> 02:05:28.487
It’s all over.

1298
02:05:30.113 --> 02:05:32.449
Let’s go home now.

1299
02:05:32.824 --> 02:05:35.494
Back to where
we came from.

1300
02:05:37.079 --> 02:05:39.289
Hey, face reader!

1301
02:05:43.085 --> 02:05:45.671
Actually it’s weird.

1302
02:05:46.421 --> 02:05:50.384
I’m already the king.
Why did you say I’ll become one?

1303
02:05:50.717 --> 02:05:52.386
Aren’t you a crook?

1304
02:05:52.678 --> 02:05:55.639
You should’ve said that
before I became the king.

1305
02:05:55.848 --> 02:05:58.809
Anybody can say
what you just said.

1306
02:06:00.811 --> 02:06:05.107
But since I asked,
I should pay.

1307
02:07:11.924 --> 02:07:13.467
Jin-hyeong!

1308
02:07:30.234 --> 02:07:33.904
No, no!
Jin-hyeong!

1309
02:07:35.531 --> 02:07:38.283
Father, save me...

1310
02:07:41.537 --> 02:07:44.122
Jin-hyeong!

1311
02:07:52.297 --> 02:07:55.008
I should’ve killed you

1312
02:07:55.759 --> 02:07:58.887
but since you helped me
I’m letting you live.

1313
02:08:31.587 --> 02:08:34.339
Jin-hyeong!

1314
02:09:18.967 --> 02:09:25.390
Did he know his son would
die at a young age?

1315
02:09:27.935 --> 02:09:30.062
I sure didn’t.

1316
02:10:01.385 --> 02:10:03.512
Hey!

1317
02:10:09.184 --> 02:10:11.603
How have you been?

1318
02:10:13.689 --> 02:10:18.610
I remember him
being very talkative.

1319
02:10:19.987 --> 02:10:24.867
Because of guilt
he cut his throat.

1320
02:10:24.867 --> 02:10:27.327
He survived
but lost his voice.

1321
02:10:37.171 --> 02:10:42.009
I didn’t want to tell him.
But I didn’t have a choice.

1322
02:10:48.015 --> 02:10:50.058
Step back!

1323
02:11:09.745 --> 02:11:11.580
It’s nice.

1324
02:11:11.580 --> 02:11:15.167
The sea breeze is fine.

1325
02:11:15.667 --> 02:11:20.088
But isn’t this
a place for retirement?

1326
02:11:20.088 --> 02:11:22.925
It’s too peaceful.

1327
02:11:24.426 --> 02:11:29.348
I don’t think
you fit here.

1328
02:11:34.269 --> 02:11:41.068
Have you recorded
all the faces of the revolters?

1329
02:11:43.529 --> 02:11:45.405
Write them down.

1330
02:11:46.406 --> 02:11:50.410
It’ll be useful to
remember all the details

1331
02:11:50.410 --> 02:11:54.081
of those who enjoy wars.

1332
02:11:54.414 --> 02:11:58.877
You think all of you
had special faces that day?

1333
02:11:59.545 --> 02:12:02.673
I saw faces of swindlers,

1334
02:12:04.049 --> 02:12:07.761
faces of butchers,

1335
02:12:09.471 --> 02:12:12.224
faces of scholars.

1336
02:12:12.224 --> 02:12:14.810
They were
just normal faces.

1337
02:12:15.394 --> 02:12:17.145
What then?

1338
02:12:17.145 --> 02:12:21.608
I’m saying, Su-yang
meant be be the king.

1339
02:12:21.608 --> 02:12:23.026
What?

1340
02:12:24.528 --> 02:12:27.197
I only saw faces.

1341
02:12:27.197 --> 02:12:29.366
I didn’t see
the changing era.

1342
02:12:29.992 --> 02:12:32.995
I only saw the waves.

1343
02:12:34.413 --> 02:12:36.665
I should have seen
the wind.

1344
02:12:37.708 --> 02:12:40.252
Wind is what
makes the waves.

1345
02:12:43.463 --> 02:12:49.094
You’re saying nothing could
have stopped our coup?

1346
02:12:49.428 --> 02:12:52.514
I’m saying you were on
the big wave at that moment.

1347
02:12:52.514 --> 02:12:55.434
We were drifting away.

1348
02:12:56.059 --> 02:12:58.896
One day
we’ll go up again.

1349
02:13:00.814 --> 02:13:03.817
Eventually the big wave
will break down.

1350
02:13:04.484 --> 02:13:06.570
Are you cursing me?

1351
02:13:12.618 --> 02:13:15.120
This is the first time
I see your face clearly.

1352
02:13:21.001 --> 02:13:22.544
It’s a weird face.

1353
02:13:22.794 --> 02:13:25.881
It looks shallow
and yet noble.

1354
02:13:27.007 --> 02:13:30.302
But, you have
a bad ending.

1355
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:33.138
You...

1356
02:13:35.098 --> 02:13:38.101
will be beheaded.

1357
02:13:57.913 --> 02:14:00.999
Time flies.

1358
02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:04.795
Everything seems
like yesterday.

1359
02:14:05.420 --> 02:14:08.131
I’m so old now.

1360
02:14:09.758 --> 02:14:17.474
After that,
I did my best to

1361
02:14:18.725 --> 02:14:21.436
not make any enemies.

1362
02:14:22.312 --> 02:14:24.606
Maybe that’s why.

1363
02:14:25.482 --> 02:14:29.528
Su-yang died
20 years ago.

1364
02:14:30.487 --> 02:14:34.408
And I’ve served
four kings.

1365
02:14:37.202 --> 02:14:39.872
You were right.

1366
02:14:40.581 --> 02:14:44.918
Face reading is
a superstition.

1367
02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:50.090
I didn’t get beheaded.

1368
02:14:53.552 --> 02:14:57.764
He was wrong after all.

1369
02:15:49.107 --> 02:15:51.193
What are you looking at?

1370
02:15:53.529 --> 02:15:55.656
The world.

1371
02:15:57.991 --> 02:16:01.370
How is the world?
