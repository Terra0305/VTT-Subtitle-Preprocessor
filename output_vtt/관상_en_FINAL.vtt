00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:10.904
You came to kill me.


00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.907
Kill you?


00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:17.369
We were just preparing your medicine.


00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.121
Get out.


00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.791
I’m sure I heard his voice.


00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.552
We doubled the security as you ordered.


00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:40.601
Nobody will harm you. You’re the most powerful man in this country.


00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:49.318
I don’t have power anymore.


00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:54.239
There’s nothing left.


00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:58.619
My wife and daughter are dead.


00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.957
I’ve nothing left.


00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:08.879
Still the king gave you the medicine,


00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.299
that chair, and the cane.


00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:16.136
That’s why I have to defend myself.


00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:21.183
The medicine’s no use if I’m going to be beheaded.


00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:25.187
Beheaded? How could say such a thing?


00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:35.989
He told me that’s how I’ll die. He said it’s on my face. Who said something like that?


00:02:36.532 --> 00:02:42.371
The face reader.


00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:46.458
Physiognomy? Isn’t that superstition?


00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.003
That’s because you never met him.


00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.800
He knew everything.


00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:58.846
He figured out everything


00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:03.267
just by looking at a face.


00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:12.192
He was the greatest face reader in Joseon.


00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:31.336
Where could this house be?


00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:35.757
I heard it’s near here.


00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:48.061
I can’t walk anymore.


00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:05.704
What the...


00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.716
We’re here.


00:04:21.512 --> 00:04:24.139
Gosh, she’s heavy.


00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.767
Nice atmosphere.


00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.270
Good view.


00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:38.278
Who are you? Is this the house of the famous face reader?


00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:41.573
What?


00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.286
Oh didn’t I tell you?


00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:52.626
They’re here to buy my brushes. You’re looking for weasel fur?


00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:57.589
Something like that.


00:05:00.092 --> 00:05:06.807
I’m going to the market. Oh, yes sure. Enjoy your day. Don’t rush!


00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:13.063
My nephew hates face reading.


00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:17.609
This way, please. Let’s go inside.


00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.287
This is the weasel tail. Very expensive.


00:05:28.287 --> 00:05:30.873
Not interested?


00:05:30.873 --> 00:05:34.376
Gosh, he’s practically naked.


00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:40.257
Nae-kyeong, get up. Get up. Get up, get up!


00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:43.760
- Uhm, yummy... - Alright, wake up.


00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:54.354
He talks in his sleep. He may look pitiful, but he’s a professional. Nae-kyeong! You have clients!


00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.316
They’re waiting.


00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:00.485
I drank too much.


00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:07.743
They want to know if it’s a good business to import silk from China.


00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.291
Go away.


00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:16.877
What?


00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:21.757
I don’t talk to liars.


00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:33.143
Mister, your eyes say you’re not good with money.


00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:37.689
Your eyebrows and round eyes are not for a businessman.


00:06:38.357 --> 00:06:42.653
More for a eunuch or a secretary.


00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:48.867
Madame is good in business but too good to be selling just silk.


00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:59.670
Peachy face and red lips say you could be a shaman. But highly unlikely. Why did you lie?


00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:04.550
I don’t know what you want, but leave if you’re going to lie.


00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.765
You take me for a fool? Lying to me like that?


00:07:11.974 --> 00:07:14.518
Where are you from?


00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.186
Are you laughing?


00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.819
Don’t lie to my brother-in-law. How dare you lie to his face so blatantly.


00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:28.824
Good. I’m glad I came.


00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:41.170
Do you know... Yeon-hong, the courtesan house in Hanyang?


00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.257
You think I’m stupid?


00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:52.222
High officials go there for face readings and stuff.


00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:55.851
She’s the madame.


00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.647
You’re a face reader?


00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:03.150
You don’t look like one.


00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.611
I’m an amateur.


00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:09.448
My experiences have taught me...


00:08:10.032 --> 00:08:11.533
a little bit about reading people.


00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:17.289
Hey, watch your hand!


00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:24.504
Why don’t you work for me?


00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:31.386
You’ll get to use your talents to the fullest.


00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:37.100
I’m the business partner.


00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.355
He only does the reading.


00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:45.108
We will pay for your service.


00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.367
Take the offer when it’s there.


00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:56.954
Life’s too short to waste it away.


00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.084
Do you want to live like this forever?


00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:04.419
Weasel? Yeah, right.


00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:08.340
My back!


00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.009
Is he any good?


00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:14.471
Not just good. He can rock the world.


00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:33.907
Rat whiskers?


00:09:36.577 --> 00:09:40.080
Give me more. You know those are rare.


00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:41.623
Wait here.


00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:47.254
My family haven’t had anything to eat.


00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:48.630
Get him out!


00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:54.261
Since you can’t pay the tax, I’ll take her instead.


00:09:54.553 --> 00:09:56.180
Sir!


00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:58.724
Please don’t!


00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.896
I have a husband, please! Alright, stay calm!


00:10:08.317 --> 00:10:10.068
That bastard!


00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.364
Are you nuts? He’s an inspector.


00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.950
- Let me go! - Please don’t.


00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.161
So, you just sit by and watch?


00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:27.211
If you do, we’ll all die. It’ll irritate him more.


00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.843
Smells good!


00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:39.264
You have to turn it over. Go away!


00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.642
You’ve no idea how to cook meat.


00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:50.150
Jin-hyeong! Did you eat yet?


00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.864
We’re eating chicken today.


00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:58.408
We have chicken!


00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.660
It’s chicken day!


00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.250
What’s with him?


00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:13.882
Have plenty.


00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.019
How did you buy a chicken?


00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.903
Those people you saw earlier,


00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:37.531
they bought our brushes.


00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:41.618
The brushes are still there.


00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:51.628
Did you read their faces? Read their faces?


00:11:54.798 --> 00:12:01.180
They were quite persistent. Am I not allowed? You promised.


00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:09.062
How can a scholar do such a crude thing? Should I study and take up a public office then?


00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:12.357
Why not?


00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.359
You’re asking me why?


00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:19.781
A traitor’s family can’t serve in the government.


00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:29.041
I saw books in your room. Don’t even think about it.


00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:30.626
Like your grandpa,


00:12:30.626 --> 00:12:35.631
you’ll be harmed if you work for the government. 
No, I’ll work for the government.


00:12:36.215 --> 00:12:41.929
Even if that means I’d be killed like my grandfather.


00:12:46.892 --> 00:12:48.519
How dare you?


00:12:55.192 --> 00:12:56.985
You even drink?


00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:05.118
I’m not a kid anymore. I’m over 17 now.


00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.455
Jin-hyeong, finish eating!


00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:15.337
What ‘s the matter? He drinks with me sometimes.


00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:21.051
You were too harsh.


00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:26.807
I want him to give up.


00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:28.517
Give up?


00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:32.437
Back when you were following around peddlers,


00:13:34.398 --> 00:13:38.652
I tried to drink myself to death.


00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:44.616
When I hung myself on the girder, I saw him looking at me and crying.


00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:47.661
He was about five.


00:13:47.953 --> 00:13:50.914
All skin and bones.


00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:55.085
“Daddy, save me...”


00:13:57.004 --> 00:14:00.840
I started to support him by begging.


00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:07.514
I think he limps because he didn’t eat properly.


00:14:09.141 --> 00:14:16.857
He’s got the intelligence and writing skills like me, but not being able to use them filled him with resentment.


00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.321
My poor sister, married to a doomed family.


00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:27.242
Do you know how rich we were in the past?


00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:30.454
All the ladies wanted to see me from a distance and...


00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:33.123
What’s in the past doesn’t count.


00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:42.007
I’m going to Yeon-hong.


00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:44.968
What?


00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:48.388
We can’t live like this forever.


00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:53.560
I learned face reading because I had nothing to do.


00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.271
It’s no use here.


00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:00.150
Maybe I can make big bucks in Hanyang.


00:15:00.776 --> 00:15:03.695
I’ll support my family with my talent.


00:15:04.321 --> 00:15:09.993
We’ll eat meat and rice. Buy new clothes. We’ll live proudly.


00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:14.957
What do we say to Jin-hyeong?


00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:23.006
We’ll leave him a note saying we went to sell the brushes.


00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:25.342
You can come back here now and then.


00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:33.016
Tomorrow you wake me up early, okay?


00:16:03.422 --> 00:16:04.965
Nae-kyeong!


00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:07.676
Jin-hyeong!


00:16:08.719 --> 00:16:10.095
Jin-hyeong!


00:16:17.978 --> 00:16:20.647
We shouldn’t have drunk so much.


00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.400
Jin-hyeong!


00:16:25.986 --> 00:16:28.488
I’m going to study at a quiet temple.


00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.825
When becoming a government official,


00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:35.078
I’ll take you two.


00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:37.831
Take care of yourselves.


00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:41.627
Please forgive me.


00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:58.310
That, that little... I’ll take him. Just let him go.


00:16:59.311 --> 00:17:03.023
We’ll be leaving soon, too.


00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:04.900
Jin-hyeong!


00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:47.734
He writes well like his grandpa, unlike his dad.


00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:52.865
His leg...


00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:56.368
Take care.


00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:01.915
My son.


00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:06.837
Come on.


00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.092
I think they’re staring at us.


00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:16.430
It’s because I look good with grooming.


00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.223
All dressed up.


00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:19.975
I think they’re looking at me.


00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:26.023
Look at them. Fish out of water!


00:18:27.024 --> 00:18:29.151
I know how to deal with country bumpkins.


00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:36.783
Prepare a big feast.


00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:39.328
Yes, ma’am.


00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.457
Hanyang is the best!


00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:46.293
Pass me that meat.


00:18:52.216 --> 00:18:56.553
We were just tasting.


00:18:57.846 --> 00:18:59.973
Just a tiny bit.


00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:02.893
- Girls. - Yes, ma’am.


00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.688
What are you doing?


00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:13.820
- Where are you...? - Hey, hey! What’s going on?!


00:19:22.538 --> 00:19:25.165
He’s the best face reader in town.


00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:27.501
Treat him like one.


00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:45.894
Sit here, sir.


00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:47.312
Pour me a glass.


00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:52.359
Can you read my face?


00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:57.114
He’s the face reader. I read hearts.


00:19:57.114 --> 00:19:58.156
Hearts?


00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:02.077
Yes, here.


00:20:03.537 --> 00:20:06.832
How about me? Men don’t like me.


00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.422
There you go. What’s this?


00:20:14.298 --> 00:20:22.514
You have pretty round face but it’s too plain. Put this on and men will find you more attractive. Is that so?


00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:23.557
You look much better.


00:20:25.726 --> 00:20:28.353
I have a question.


00:20:28.854 --> 00:20:34.067
There are two big powers in this country: Lee and Kim.


00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:39.823
They fight everyday, killing people here and there. It’s quite terrifying.


00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.577
Who do you think will win at in the end?


00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:49.041
I heard the rumors early on. Lee is Prince Su-yang and Kim is Kim Jong-seo.


00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:50.375
Yes.


00:20:51.001 --> 00:21:07.434
But I can’t tell because I haven’t seen their faces. People say Lee looks like a wolf and Kim resembles a tiger. A wolf and a tiger.


00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.186
Let me think.


00:21:10.521 --> 00:21:12.105
Aha!


00:21:20.364 --> 00:21:24.368
How would I know? Stronger one will win.


00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:29.540
It’s time for the contract.


00:21:29.915 --> 00:21:31.416
Contract?


00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:42.219
I wouldn’t know even if I read... Don’t bore us with this stuff. Yeah, don’t make the ladies wait! It’s time to read hearts.


00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:50.143
Good gracious. What a mess.


00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:53.814
Hey, get up. Rise and shine!


00:21:58.986 --> 00:22:00.612
Who are you?


00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:04.783
It’s me. You don’t remember?


00:22:04.783 --> 00:22:07.578
- Get ready for the clients! - Clients?


00:22:07.578 --> 00:22:10.122
Don’t you remember the contract?


00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:21.466
Do you know how much you drank? “I agree to see clients from sun rise to sun down...” Had fun with the girls last night?


00:22:21.717 --> 00:22:27.389
“...flogging?” What’s this? Hey, this isn’t fair.


00:22:27.806 --> 00:22:34.438
You think you can rip us off?


00:22:34.438 --> 00:22:43.071
You are so wrong! Hey, let go!


00:22:43.071 --> 00:22:48.076
You little rat! Let me go!


00:22:50.162 --> 00:22:51.788
I’m sorry, sir.


00:23:00.797 --> 00:23:03.342
Line up!


00:23:03.926 --> 00:23:06.011
How long do we have to do this?


00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:13.602
This is good. Making easy bucks! It’s so easy!


00:23:13.977 --> 00:23:19.398
My wits are better than face reading.


00:23:22.152 --> 00:23:24.947
Come quickly.


00:23:24.947 --> 00:23:29.034
You still have twenty more to carry.


00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:32.746
Can’t believe this.


00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.837
We shouldn’t have drunk that day.


00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:42.256
I told you we should stop!


00:23:42.506 --> 00:23:45.968
What? “Reading hearts,” if I recall.


00:23:47.094 --> 00:23:49.054
Oh my gosh!


00:23:51.473 --> 00:23:53.684
That’s does it!


00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.145
- I’ve had it! - Hey!


00:23:57.145 --> 00:23:58.814
I told you to give up your temper.


00:24:02.943 --> 00:24:05.445
You can’t live like the old days.


00:24:06.238 --> 00:24:08.490
Then you’ll just sit here and let them do this?


00:24:08.782 --> 00:24:15.497
We can’t undo the contract even if you go beat them up. You’ll get flogged.


00:24:17.583 --> 00:24:25.215
I told you your temper will ruin you.


00:24:27.134 --> 00:24:30.012
Nothing’s solved by foul temper.


00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.144
Where are you going?


00:24:41.398 --> 00:24:47.321
I’ve been observing for a few days, this room is quite suspicious.


00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:50.490
It might be a room for special clients.


00:24:51.992 --> 00:24:56.538
To succeed, you need to meet the big shots


00:25:08.175 --> 00:25:09.551
You see?


00:25:15.641 --> 00:25:17.226
Come in.


00:25:17.809 --> 00:25:20.187
You two can wait here.


00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:35.494
- Was I right? - Yes.


00:25:42.543 --> 00:25:45.712
Look at that flabby ass.


00:25:46.004 --> 00:25:48.715
I told you to keep your muscles tight at all times.


00:25:49.925 --> 00:25:51.093
That’s better!


00:25:54.137 --> 00:25:57.599
I’m worried I look fat because of my big breasts.


00:26:00.435 --> 00:26:01.228
Take it down!


00:26:01.395 --> 00:26:05.315
Do you want me to pop them like a pig’s bladder?


00:26:05.566 --> 00:26:07.734
No thanks!


00:26:12.906 --> 00:26:14.575
Let me see.


00:26:19.121 --> 00:26:21.123
She’s blocking again.


00:26:23.667 --> 00:26:25.961
Looks like you’ll bear a son.


00:26:27.796 --> 00:26:34.469
Sir Jang Nyeong from the Inspection Board is here. - Isn’t he Kim Jong-seo’s man? - Yes.


00:26:35.262 --> 00:26:39.933
There’s been a murder case. He wants you to find the murderer.


00:26:39.933 --> 00:26:46.565
How would I know that just by looking at faces?


00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:50.569
That’s crazy.


00:26:54.573 --> 00:26:57.284
Sir Jang Nyeong!


00:26:57.701 --> 00:27:03.248
It’s an honor to serve you at my humble place.


00:27:03.916 --> 00:27:13.217
I’m sorry for visiting you like this. No problem. Inspection Board official’s involved in this case.


00:27:14.092 --> 00:27:22.267
It’s quite urgent. I heard you’re very good. That’s right. I’ve heard the gist of it,


00:27:22.684 --> 00:27:27.189
I know it’s inconvenient, but I’m refraining from...


00:27:36.406 --> 00:27:37.658
Sir Jang Nyeong!


00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.618
Who’s this?


00:27:42.204 --> 00:27:45.415
I’m Kim Nae-kyeong, her business partner.


00:27:46.416 --> 00:27:49.336
Why were you in there?


00:27:52.464 --> 00:27:55.300
Precious view in there.


00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.595
“Private” readings, huh? I want referrals.


00:27:59.179 --> 00:28:05.811
Madame here told me to assist you in your investigation, sir Is that so?


00:28:06.478 --> 00:28:08.939
You knew I’d come!


00:28:18.198 --> 00:28:21.368
These three were at the site.


00:28:21.952 --> 00:28:24.705
But they won’t admit even after tortures.


00:28:25.038 --> 00:28:27.499
I’m sure it’s one of them.


00:28:40.804 --> 00:28:43.307
The murder was committed this morning.


00:28:43.307 --> 00:28:45.809
You probably still have the body.


00:28:46.602 --> 00:28:48.437
I’d like to see it.


00:28:50.689 --> 00:28:55.611
If you look at the face of the victim, broad forehead and high ear bones,


00:28:55.611 --> 00:28:59.656
meaning she’s destined to live a long life.


00:29:00.908 --> 00:29:04.077
It’s clearly a murder case.


00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:07.789
Are you the husband?


00:29:10.459 --> 00:29:12.628
Why did you kill your wife?


00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:15.255
What?


00:29:15.756 --> 00:29:20.177
My reading tells me you weren’t compatible with each other.


00:29:21.136 --> 00:29:24.097
It must have been difficult.


00:29:24.598 --> 00:29:30.020
Faces of weasel and chicken. They can’t hit it off together.


00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:34.566
- Hey. - Yes, sir.


00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.486
- Take him into custody. - Yes, sir.


00:29:37.945 --> 00:29:44.785
Meeting a right match is more important than good face.


00:29:45.244 --> 00:29:48.956
If it weren’t for you, we would’ve condemned an innocent man.


00:29:52.209 --> 00:29:57.464
It’s my pleasure to help the innocent.


00:30:00.092 --> 00:30:04.263
This is way more than what we made before!


00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.015
We gotta get out of here.


00:30:07.015 --> 00:30:10.060
How do we trick that vile woman?


00:30:12.354 --> 00:30:15.649
Kim Nae-kyeong, are you the best face reader in town?


00:30:16.692 --> 00:30:18.026
Who are you?


00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:27.578
Paeng-heon!


00:30:45.262 --> 00:30:46.847
Is this him?


00:30:49.266 --> 00:30:53.020
The man who found the murderer by reading faces?


00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.147
Yes, he’s unbelievable.


00:30:56.398 --> 00:30:57.858
What should we do?


00:31:21.423 --> 00:31:24.343
He could be a problem. Kill him.


00:31:33.435 --> 00:31:35.062
You have to go.


00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:41.568
- Take care of him. - Yes, sir.


00:32:05.676 --> 00:32:06.885
Let’s go.


00:32:13.684 --> 00:32:15.894
They dropped something here.


00:32:57.811 --> 00:32:59.354
What are you doing?


00:33:06.028 --> 00:33:11.074
I was in a dust storm in my dream.


00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:13.076
And now I have real sand in my mouth.


00:33:13.202 --> 00:33:15.579
That’s from the muddy well.


00:33:16.121 --> 00:33:18.207
I had sandy mouth, too.


00:33:19.541 --> 00:33:24.213
So the murderer I caught was one of Su-yang’s men?


00:33:24.213 --> 00:33:26.173
That’s why they tried to kill us.


00:33:26.757 --> 00:33:27.841
Correct.


00:33:29.051 --> 00:33:39.228
If not for Kim Jong-seo’s men, we’d be dead by now. That’s what I heard.


00:33:40.437 --> 00:33:43.315
He could be a problem. Kill him.


00:33:44.358 --> 00:33:45.692
Let’s leave.


00:33:46.193 --> 00:33:46.985
What?


00:33:46.985 --> 00:33:49.071
Money’s not worth our lives.


00:33:55.786 --> 00:33:58.080
- Where are you going? - Gosh!


00:33:59.581 --> 00:34:00.874
Sir Jang Nyeong.


00:34:02.543 --> 00:34:15.764
I am a simple face reader, doing simple work, I think it best to stay out of politics. I’m sorry about that. No need. We’ll be off then.


00:34:17.224 --> 00:34:21.520
Before you go, there’s someone who wants to see you.


00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.146
Why don’t you come say hello?


00:34:23.313 --> 00:34:31.947
- Perhaps another time. - Yes, later. - There’s no later. - No, thank you. He’s a busy man. We’re fine!


00:34:32.447 --> 00:34:33.824
That’s weird.


00:34:34.408 --> 00:34:38.412
Never seen anyone refuse to see Lord Kim Jong-seo.


00:34:40.163 --> 00:34:43.500
Did you say Lord Kim Jong-seo?


00:34:44.293 --> 00:34:45.377
Indeed.


00:34:45.878 --> 00:34:48.881
He was curious about you.


00:34:49.214 --> 00:34:52.885
But since you’re too busy... Wait, wait!


00:34:53.135 --> 00:34:57.472
It’s part of our job to get into trouble.


00:34:58.015 --> 00:35:01.518
It’s what happens when we tell the truth.


00:35:01.768 --> 00:35:03.437
It happens quite often.


00:35:03.437 --> 00:35:06.565
- All the time. - Every time.


00:35:06.565 --> 00:35:07.608
Let’s go.


00:35:08.066 --> 00:35:10.068
Where is he?


00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:30.506
Is he the one who caught the murderer by reading faces?


00:35:30.964 --> 00:35:33.383
His name is Kim Nae-kyeong.


00:35:41.767 --> 00:35:43.018
Bold.


00:35:43.393 --> 00:35:44.394
Stubborn.


00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:45.812
Principled.


00:35:46.897 --> 00:35:48.607
He’s exactly as they say.


00:35:49.358 --> 00:35:51.151
What a remarkable face!


00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.614
A face of a tiger.


00:35:56.782 --> 00:35:59.701
Why are you staring at me?


00:36:00.452 --> 00:36:02.160
Do I have a good face?


00:36:05.582 --> 00:36:06.750
Yes.


00:36:08.502 --> 00:36:12.339
You’ve got a distinguished face as people say.


00:36:14.049 --> 00:36:16.927
Do they say I look like a tiger?


00:36:19.972 --> 00:36:21.306
Yes.


00:36:22.474 --> 00:36:27.187
You’re brave and strong like a tiger.


00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.567
You’re a tiger.


00:36:31.567 --> 00:36:33.318
A tiger himself.


00:36:37.281 --> 00:36:40.367
He asked you to hire people at the Inspection Board?


00:36:40.367 --> 00:36:41.577
Yes.


00:36:41.577 --> 00:36:44.037
So you’re an official now?


00:36:45.038 --> 00:36:49.960
It’s not really a job since I’m just there to give advice.


00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.630
But it’s pretty important work. You’re an official!


00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.550
Don’t laugh! People will talk. Act calm.


00:37:00.053 --> 00:37:03.015
One has to be modest.


00:37:06.435 --> 00:37:09.021
Civil service, here. Military service, there.


00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:16.653
Human face is the embodiment of nature and its order.


00:37:16.653 --> 00:37:19.615
Head shall be round like the sky.


00:37:19.615 --> 00:37:27.039
Eyes shall shine like the sun and the moon. Mouth is the sea, philtrum is the river. It should be long and impressive.


00:37:27.039 --> 00:37:37.007
Nose, cheekbones, and chin shall be high like mountains. Hair must be fine and abundant like trees and grass.


00:37:37.299 --> 00:37:42.888
If you take these into account, you won’t make huge mistakes.


00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:47.893
This candidate is handsome and is from a good family. I’d like to hire him.


00:37:49.853 --> 00:37:53.273
How many times do I have to tell you?


00:37:53.565 --> 00:38:02.280
Scribes need to record all the time. It’s not good to change scribes often. But this one likes to drink.


00:38:02.449 --> 00:38:09.581
He might develop dementia later. Also, he’s unstable and likes to change jobs often.


00:38:11.208 --> 00:38:13.252
Are you the candidate’s cousin?


00:38:13.544 --> 00:38:16.713
Does he like to drink?


00:38:17.381 --> 00:38:22.135
Yes, he drinks like a fish and then some.


00:38:23.136 --> 00:38:27.140
You should hire him as a wine taster.


00:38:33.438 --> 00:38:34.857
Who’s that?


00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:37.943
Why do you ask?


00:38:38.151 --> 00:38:43.407
- He looks... - What? Rotten, completely.


00:38:49.454 --> 00:38:53.292
52 bags of whole grain. 43 bags of refined grain.


00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:58.881
34 rolls of silk and 40 ounces of silver.


00:38:58.881 --> 00:39:01.049
He gathered all these illegally?


00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.803
How did you know? He looked so naïve.


00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:09.600
His eyes are charming, but his mouth is sly.


00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.934
That’s a bad sign.


00:39:11.685 --> 00:39:14.479
He’d have ripped off everything if I had not caught him.


00:39:16.523 --> 00:39:22.029
Isn’t she the one who had men troubles?


00:39:22.029 --> 00:39:28.243
After you put watermelon seed on her, she’s been the talk of the town.


00:39:28.952 --> 00:39:39.421
What? She still keeps the seed on the face? No, Yeon-hong made her a mole with pig blood.


00:39:39.922 --> 00:39:45.093
Amazing. Changing one’s fate, huh?


00:39:45.886 --> 00:39:47.137
Please change mine, too.


00:39:48.472 --> 00:39:51.725
This isn’t gonna work.


00:39:52.851 --> 00:39:55.771
He’ll come soon. Wait here.


00:39:55.771 --> 00:39:57.064
What’s this?


00:39:57.064 --> 00:39:58.065
It’s precious ginseng.


00:39:58.065 --> 00:40:01.652
- Ginseng? - Yes.


00:40:01.652 --> 00:40:06.657
Come to the front.


00:40:07.324 --> 00:40:09.284
Please line up straight.


00:40:10.077 --> 00:40:11.411
What’s this?


00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:13.997
Dried persimmons. You need to wait.


00:40:14.081 --> 00:40:16.333
Put them here.


00:40:18.043 --> 00:40:24.591
Why are you on the line? You’re funny.


00:40:24.591 --> 00:40:28.053
They’re all here to see you.


00:40:28.387 --> 00:40:38.522
They want you to read faces and pick out corrupted officials. Look what they brought. Black peppers and ice! That’s cold!


00:40:39.857 --> 00:40:41.066
Mr. Kim!


00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.402
Don’t look surprised.


00:40:44.194 --> 00:40:46.822
Ice and peppers are silly.


00:40:46.822 --> 00:40:48.615
Why are you on the line?


00:40:49.324 --> 00:40:56.290
I’m here to see the greatest face reader called Mr. Kim.


00:40:59.126 --> 00:41:00.294
Follow me.


00:41:00.294 --> 00:41:01.962
Where are we going?


00:41:01.962 --> 00:41:06.717
I have prepared a nice place for you near here.


00:41:06.717 --> 00:41:08.466
You should come.


00:41:08.927 --> 00:41:10.721
I also prepared a palanquin.


00:41:11.096 --> 00:41:12.556
A palanquin?


00:41:13.182 --> 00:41:17.060
We’re partners, aren’t we? Paeng-heon.


00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:27.446
Don’t you feel like we’re walking on the cloud? I feel like the world is mine. Do you want a ride?


00:41:29.239 --> 00:41:32.367
Maybe next time?


00:41:36.955 --> 00:41:43.212
Is it my fault that there are so many corrupted officials?


00:41:48.383 --> 00:41:51.845
There were always corrupted officials


00:41:51.845 --> 00:41:55.933
under any king, Your Majesty.


00:41:55.933 --> 00:42:00.187
But why so many now?


00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:06.944
I hired an amazing face reader as an inspector, Your Majesty.


00:42:08.445 --> 00:42:13.825
He’s at the Inspection Board.


00:42:14.368 --> 00:42:18.956
He’s excellent at finding people who’s got anything to hide.


00:42:32.678 --> 00:42:36.390
I am Your Majesty’s


00:42:37.516 --> 00:42:40.018
most humble and obedient servant.


00:42:46.024 --> 00:42:47.818
You can


00:42:48.443 --> 00:42:51.196
see through people?


00:42:56.535 --> 00:43:01.290
I don’t intend to. It’s just...


00:43:02.958 --> 00:43:05.460
my humble talent.


00:43:24.938 --> 00:43:28.275
That’s very intriguing. However,


00:43:28.275 --> 00:43:32.821
despite being able to read people’s past,


00:43:33.864 --> 00:43:37.659
you probably can’t read the future, right?


00:43:38.452 --> 00:43:41.496
Isn’t that for the gods?


00:43:45.834 --> 00:43:47.961
Actually...


00:43:48.879 --> 00:43:53.008
if you take a good look at the past,


00:43:53.008 --> 00:43:57.930
you can predict the future quite accurately.


00:43:58.847 --> 00:44:03.644
Of course, you can’t know everything - but the general direction... - Nonsense!


00:44:07.606 --> 00:44:11.944
You should use your skill to encourage people,


00:44:12.444 --> 00:44:15.364
not to make them worry.


00:44:15.739 --> 00:44:18.534
If that’s the case, you better shut your mouth.


00:44:18.534 --> 00:44:20.827
I’ll keep a close eye on you.


00:44:21.245 --> 00:44:26.124
If I see anything suspicious, you will be removed.


00:44:36.093 --> 00:44:40.222
Did I do anything wrong?


00:44:40.806 --> 00:44:43.684
Why is he angry at me?


00:44:45.686 --> 00:44:47.855
He’s the one who wanted to see me.


00:44:48.438 --> 00:44:50.691
Where did he get this mutt?


00:44:51.358 --> 00:44:59.074
He’s out now. He’ll be late. Come back tomorrow. Who do you think you’re talking to?


00:44:59.324 --> 00:45:00.617
What’s going on?


00:45:01.034 --> 00:45:02.744
Don’t mind here.


00:45:03.287 --> 00:45:06.373
If you come late at night like this


00:45:06.373 --> 00:45:11.253
you gotta bring something, you know.


00:45:12.379 --> 00:45:16.133
Bring something tomorrow


00:45:16.884 --> 00:45:18.051
other than those swords.


00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:33.025
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!


00:45:37.905 --> 00:45:42.284
Come on, are you kidding me? You’re the king?


00:45:44.077 --> 00:45:47.539
- Hey, hey. - The king!


00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:51.418
The king.


00:46:02.012 --> 00:46:06.600
I came here unofficially


00:46:06.808 --> 00:46:12.064
because I don’t want this in the record.


00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:18.362
Some people want to take over the throne.


00:46:20.155 --> 00:46:23.408
Figure out who they are


00:46:24.284 --> 00:46:28.830
so I can prepare for a possible coup.


00:46:31.708 --> 00:46:33.418
My king!


00:46:33.418 --> 00:46:36.797
I’ve never seen the faces of important men.


00:46:37.464 --> 00:46:43.804
I’m not fit for... Find those who are willing to step on others


00:46:43.804 --> 00:46:47.808
and those who are willing to kill for what they want.


00:46:49.059 --> 00:46:54.857
As my condition gets worse it’s hard to tell what’s going to happen in the future.


00:46:55.482 --> 00:46:57.943
I want to depend on you.


00:46:58.402 --> 00:47:07.995
You can disguise as my attendant and look at those people. It’s best to look at them at places they’re familiar with.


00:47:09.663 --> 00:47:13.584
Do you have any good ideas?


00:47:23.093 --> 00:47:26.722
The man who killed his brothers to become a king.


00:47:27.514 --> 00:47:31.727
Lee Bang-won. A traitor’s face.


00:47:39.484 --> 00:47:44.656
You think he’ll reward us when you succeed?


00:47:44.907 --> 00:47:45.908
What?


00:47:46.158 --> 00:47:50.579
The king appointed you personally!


00:47:50.787 --> 00:47:53.081
I think he’ll give you an important position.


00:47:54.666 --> 00:47:56.126
Yes, yes.


00:47:57.002 --> 00:48:00.088
Wasn’t sure what to make of it,


00:48:00.088 --> 00:48:04.510
but my time has come, this is it.


00:48:05.677 --> 00:48:07.095
Is that so?


00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:11.600
- Lord Nae-kyeong! - Hey, stop it.


00:48:14.311 --> 00:48:16.271
What?


00:48:22.528 --> 00:48:29.284
His Majesty bestowed this painting upon me? The first one I read was Premier Hwang Bo-in.


00:48:30.744 --> 00:48:34.540
He’s a typical nobleman.


00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:39.837
He’s lazy and is happy with the status quo.


00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.464
How about my brother An-pyeong?


00:48:43.006 --> 00:48:44.675
Prince An-pyeong.


00:48:44.675 --> 00:48:46.468
An honest man.


00:48:46.885 --> 00:48:48.637
Excellent eye for beauty.


00:48:50.055 --> 00:48:54.184
He doesn’t consider his noble birth special.


00:48:54.184 --> 00:48:58.313
He’s too delicate to become a killer.


00:49:02.442 --> 00:49:07.239
When he saw bugs, he drew them instead of killing.


00:49:07.656 --> 00:49:10.409
Shin Suk-ju is a very smart man.


00:49:10.701 --> 00:49:14.329
He has reached his position easily.


00:49:15.247 --> 00:49:19.710
That’s why he’s more interested in women than power.


00:49:24.047 --> 00:49:29.845
You will read Prince Su-yang next.


00:49:31.513 --> 00:49:35.517
He’s the most ambitious one among my brothers.


00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:42.441
Please look into his soul.


00:50:13.263 --> 00:50:15.390
He gave me a painting?


00:50:25.234 --> 00:50:27.444
Is he Prince Su-yang?


00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:58.058
He’s afraid of you. He doesn’t have the guts to steal the throne.


00:50:58.058 --> 00:51:00.686
He is easily pleased with small things.


00:51:00.686 --> 00:51:03.981
Your Majesty has nothing to worry about.


00:51:05.232 --> 00:51:06.525
You sure?


00:51:06.942 --> 00:51:08.735
I’m sure.


00:51:16.869 --> 00:51:18.829
Do you have children?


00:51:19.288 --> 00:51:21.081
I have a son.


00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:24.585
It doesn’t matter when I die.


00:51:24.585 --> 00:51:27.504
But I worry about the Crown Prince.


00:51:27.504 --> 00:51:32.676
How would that young thing survive in this menacing world?


00:51:34.219 --> 00:51:36.346
I cannot fathom.


00:51:53.572 --> 00:51:55.699
They’ve passed the state exam.


00:51:55.699 --> 00:51:56.408
I see.


00:52:08.545 --> 00:52:11.173
Do you know him?


00:52:12.132 --> 00:52:13.467
No.


00:52:14.468 --> 00:52:16.887
He looked familiar.


00:52:17.429 --> 00:52:19.515
It’s nothing.


00:52:20.432 --> 00:52:23.268
He changed his name.


00:52:25.687 --> 00:52:27.397
Let me ask you a question.


00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:32.986
You got the highest score. What was the hardest task?


00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.582
It was not giving in to destiny.


00:52:56.677 --> 00:52:58.512
Father!


00:52:59.137 --> 00:53:01.849
Destiny? Give in?


00:53:03.767 --> 00:53:05.644
I won’t allow this.


00:53:05.936 --> 00:53:08.313
I told you I’ll become an official.


00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:13.110
I couldn’t use my name so I borrowed other’s.


00:53:15.487 --> 00:53:18.824
But, why are you here?


00:53:18.824 --> 00:53:21.785
Because Lord Kim Jong-seo...


00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.956
It’s not the point. That’s not the point, is it?


00:53:29.126 --> 00:53:32.212
You already sensed he took the top place?


00:53:43.265 --> 00:53:45.100
I’m sorry, father.


00:53:51.231 --> 00:53:52.858
Alright, go.


00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.403
Pardon?


00:53:57.112 --> 00:54:02.534
Since you took the job, do your best.


00:54:12.044 --> 00:54:13.962
I knew it!


00:54:15.005 --> 00:54:17.925
I knew he’d pass.


00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:22.888
He could become a minister! Nonsense.


00:54:23.847 --> 00:54:26.767
Right now he has a small position,


00:54:26.767 --> 00:54:32.105
but if he keeps lying it’ll be hard to become even a small town official.


00:54:38.529 --> 00:54:40.489
Are you Kim Nae-kyeong?


00:54:41.031 --> 00:54:42.783
Yes?


00:54:43.408 --> 00:54:47.120
The king left a special order for you.


00:54:48.247 --> 00:54:52.626
Kim Nae-kyeong, accept the king’s letter.


00:55:03.929 --> 00:55:07.891
Your Majesty!


00:55:09.393 --> 00:55:14.314
By the time you read this, I will be in the afterlife.


00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:21.613
It is painful to think that my son will be alone.


00:55:23.198 --> 00:55:26.910
It’ll be hard for him to hold on to his throne alone.


00:55:27.452 --> 00:55:30.372
I want you and Kim Jong-seo to help him.


00:55:31.331 --> 00:55:37.171
You know what it is like to have a son.


00:55:37.754 --> 00:55:44.428
Please treat my son like your own.


00:56:03.113 --> 00:56:06.617
His Majesty knew all along.


00:56:06.617 --> 00:56:12.706
But nobody had the face of a traitor.


00:56:15.918 --> 00:56:18.086
How about Su-yang?


00:56:19.796 --> 00:56:26.720
The king had ordered me to inspect him closely. And since he’s your enemy, I paid more attention.


00:56:27.221 --> 00:56:30.057
But he was of no importance.


00:56:30.474 --> 00:56:32.184
Nonsense!


00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:37.689
I may know nothing, but he’s got a look of a traitor.


00:56:38.982 --> 00:56:39.983
What?


00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.445
Follow me. Check it out yourself.


00:56:54.206 --> 00:56:57.251
Prince Su-yang is coming!


00:58:04.401 --> 00:58:16.580
Find those who are willing to step on others and those who are willing to kill for what they want.


00:58:21.126 --> 00:58:23.754
He’s a vicious wolf.


00:58:24.087 --> 00:58:27.382
He will rip your throat out.


00:58:27.966 --> 00:58:29.551
He has


00:58:33.055 --> 00:58:35.224
a traitor’s face.


00:58:37.518 --> 00:58:39.937
Hunting during a wake?


00:58:40.562 --> 00:58:43.232
People won’t take it kindly.


00:58:43.815 --> 00:58:47.277
It was just an archery practice with friends.


00:58:47.277 --> 00:58:49.821
Don’t fret over it.


00:58:52.032 --> 00:58:57.246
Who’s that with you?


00:58:58.622 --> 00:59:01.458
He’s my aide.


00:59:04.253 --> 00:59:09.550
Aren’t you the famous face reader?


00:59:16.473 --> 00:59:18.517
My instinct’s right!


00:59:18.517 --> 00:59:23.397
Lord, you believe in face reading like the late king?


00:59:23.397 --> 00:59:26.441
What can you say about my face?


00:59:28.068 --> 00:59:33.365
My grandma used to say I have handsome ears.


00:59:33.365 --> 00:59:35.534
Is that true?


00:59:38.954 --> 00:59:40.831
They’re perfect.


00:59:47.129 --> 00:59:51.341
I’m having a party soon.


00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:54.011
You should come.


00:59:59.349 --> 01:00:01.143
I was a fool.


01:00:02.394 --> 01:00:04.605
I read the wrong man.


01:00:05.731 --> 01:00:10.068
This man won’t be afraid of blood for the throne.


01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.198
But how did they know I was coming?


01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:27.419
Kim Nae-kyeong!


01:00:34.092 --> 01:00:36.303
Hey, face reader.


01:00:36.637 --> 01:00:38.472
How have you been?


01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:47.606
He could be a problem. Kill him. Why don’t you read my face too?


01:01:10.587 --> 01:01:13.215
Face reader Kim.


01:01:14.174 --> 01:01:19.429
You work hard these days. Have you been following me?


01:01:19.638 --> 01:01:24.434
You have an interesting talent. I’ve warned Su-yang about you.


01:01:25.018 --> 01:01:29.982
That’s how I got you and your king fooled.


01:01:31.525 --> 01:01:33.151
I have an offer.


01:01:34.444 --> 01:01:37.531
Let us change the world together.


01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.284
Nothing difficult.


01:01:40.284 --> 01:01:43.871
All you have to do is tell this to the king.


01:01:45.706 --> 01:01:50.752
Late king had told you to find a potential traitor and


01:01:50.752 --> 01:02:00.429
that person you found was Kim Jong-seo. Tell him Kim is plotting for a coup and he should be stopped.


01:02:00.596 --> 01:02:02.055
What say you?


01:02:03.515 --> 01:02:06.602
Get rid of Kim and put Su-yang on the throne?


01:02:06.602 --> 01:02:09.229
Never in my life will I help you commit treason.


01:02:09.897 --> 01:02:13.358
Do you think I’ll kill you that easily?


01:02:13.942 --> 01:02:17.738
I’ll gouge your eyes out


01:02:17.738 --> 01:02:19.865
so you can’t read faces anymore.


01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:22.576
Not only that.


01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:26.622
I’ll cut off both legs of your brother-in-law.


01:02:26.622 --> 01:02:30.501
You devil! And I’ll find your one and only son.


01:02:30.501 --> 01:02:37.216
I’ll find him and butcher him.


01:02:41.386 --> 01:02:42.471
Don’t you dare!


01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:52.231
Mr. Kim Nae-kyeong,


01:02:53.899 --> 01:02:58.403
I know you want to restore your family’s honor.


01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.240
If Su-yang becomes the king,


01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:06.995
your family will prosper for generations to come.


01:03:07.412 --> 01:03:09.786
Chance of a lifetime.


01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:12.543
Think about it.


01:03:50.706 --> 01:03:53.083
They vetted you.


01:03:54.293 --> 01:04:00.757
They’ll find us wherever we go.


01:04:05.262 --> 01:04:07.139
Let’s do as they say.


01:04:08.432 --> 01:04:12.144
I heard Su-yang is very generous


01:04:12.144 --> 01:04:14.271
and loyal to his men.


01:04:15.564 --> 01:04:20.485
How can you ask so easily to commit treason?


01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:24.156
Think about it!


01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:33.040
Think about your son, Jin-hyeong.


01:04:35.626 --> 01:04:39.046
He’s hiding his name to keep a small position.


01:04:40.756 --> 01:04:42.841
That kid could become a minister!


01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:46.220
Isn’t success what you wanted?


01:04:47.346 --> 01:04:49.223
This is the only way!


01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:54.269
Just think of Jin-hyeong.


01:05:33.851 --> 01:05:34.935
Who’s that?


01:05:36.895 --> 01:05:38.856
Why are you here?


01:05:39.273 --> 01:05:41.275
Vice Premier Kim ordered us to come.


01:05:41.275 --> 01:05:44.820
He wants you to report the number and names of


01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.071
every illegal soldier you have.


01:05:46.697 --> 01:05:50.492
Tell him to focus on educating the young king.


01:05:50.492 --> 01:05:52.786
What is the point of this?


01:05:52.786 --> 01:06:00.085
These are all the soldiers you have? Three’s more than enough to hunt a cub.


01:06:02.379 --> 01:06:03.964
How dare you.


01:06:03.964 --> 01:06:05.757
That’s very rude.


01:06:35.704 --> 01:06:37.122
It’s a perfect shot.


01:06:37.122 --> 01:06:38.790
You hit the tiger!


01:06:39.124 --> 01:06:42.044
I thought I saw something.


01:06:42.211 --> 01:06:45.130
It was a tiger you caught earlier.


01:06:46.215 --> 01:06:49.384
Please let me catch it next time?


01:06:49.384 --> 01:06:50.469
Of course!


01:06:52.513 --> 01:06:57.726
Wait! Let’s give this tiger to Lord Kim as a present.


01:06:58.852 --> 01:07:00.979
Should I skin it first?


01:07:00.979 --> 01:07:02.940
Or cut the head first?


01:07:03.315 --> 01:07:06.026
That’s a hard question.


01:07:14.326 --> 01:07:15.702
My lord!


01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:17.955
Please be calm!


01:07:59.663 --> 01:08:02.165
You don’t have to hide.


01:08:02.165 --> 01:08:03.792
I knew you’d be here.


01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:07.379
Between a tiger and a wolf.


01:08:07.963 --> 01:08:10.674
Haven’t made up your mind yet?


01:08:10.674 --> 01:08:11.842
Why are you here?


01:08:13.343 --> 01:08:17.264
Every famous fortunetellers and face readers are here.


01:08:17.264 --> 01:08:18.891
Of course I’m invited.


01:08:19.266 --> 01:08:21.894
People are so fast.


01:08:22.978 --> 01:08:26.773
They’re attracted to power as moths are to light.


01:08:27.858 --> 01:08:30.611
Who would stay with the young king?


01:08:31.403 --> 01:08:35.574
This looks exactly like the palace.


01:09:22.579 --> 01:09:24.164
Now,


01:09:24.498 --> 01:09:26.667
shall we talk about my fortune?


01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:32.506
You will be the new leader of the eastern peninsula!


01:09:33.549 --> 01:09:37.177
Oh my king!


01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:42.307
Please lead us from ignorance!


01:09:48.438 --> 01:09:52.609
Your face’s five points resemble the king’s mountain.


01:09:53.777 --> 01:09:55.195
Is that true?


01:09:57.322 --> 01:10:00.242
Pardon me? Are you telling the truth?


01:10:01.618 --> 01:10:03.078
Of course.


01:10:17.009 --> 01:10:20.971
Your expression says otherwise.


01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:25.601
Tell me the truth.


01:10:28.061 --> 01:10:30.939
- Your Highness... - Tell me!


01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:36.528
Without a coup, you won’t be able to


01:10:37.196 --> 01:10:39.489
become a king.


01:10:40.157 --> 01:10:42.159
Please don’t commit treason.


01:10:42.159 --> 01:10:43.911
It’ll be a tragedy for this country.


01:10:43.911 --> 01:10:48.332
This country is founded by the Lees.


01:10:48.332 --> 01:10:51.793
Why is a Kim trying to ruin everything?


01:10:53.629 --> 01:10:59.051
The old tiger you work for could kill the young king.


01:11:07.351 --> 01:11:09.728
I know you work for Kim.


01:11:35.379 --> 01:11:38.507
Oh, it’s you!


01:11:41.468 --> 01:11:43.262
I’m glad to see you.


01:11:43.262 --> 01:11:45.806
Things were getting boring.


01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:48.934
Would you read my face?


01:11:49.226 --> 01:11:52.813
Am I going to be the king?


01:11:55.107 --> 01:11:57.192
Tell me.


01:11:57.192 --> 01:11:59.736
Do I have a king’s face?


01:12:07.202 --> 01:12:09.162
Perhaps I have odd features.


01:12:11.248 --> 01:12:14.751
Even the best face reader can’t read my face.


01:12:16.211 --> 01:12:20.924
Make up your mind quickly.


01:12:22.759 --> 01:12:27.890
Because it’ll be too late when I’m already the king.


01:12:40.944 --> 01:12:44.740
You could’ve said what he wanted.


01:12:45.782 --> 01:12:47.868
You could’ve been killed.


01:13:03.926 --> 01:13:06.053
Are you doing well?


01:13:07.179 --> 01:13:08.388
Huh?


01:13:09.014 --> 01:13:11.266
I know what it’s like.


01:13:13.268 --> 01:13:15.771
It’s difficult when you first start.


01:13:17.606 --> 01:13:23.362
I’m happy when I help people in need.


01:13:24.112 --> 01:13:26.865
If you hadn’t born in our family,


01:13:27.449 --> 01:13:32.037
you could‘ve kept your name and done much better.


01:13:32.746 --> 01:13:34.623
You don’t feel bitter?


01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.837
I do feel bitter.


01:13:44.424 --> 01:13:48.470
That’s why I investigated grandfather’s case.


01:13:52.599 --> 01:13:55.018
He had committed many crimes.


01:13:55.686 --> 01:14:00.357
Because of him, many people died and the country was harmed.


01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:09.032
But rather than feeling bitter for myself,


01:14:09.825 --> 01:14:12.244
I decided to focus on my work.


01:14:13.829 --> 01:14:20.836
Perhaps I’ll be able to wash away some of his sins.


01:14:26.758 --> 01:14:28.260
Thank you.


01:14:30.554 --> 01:14:31.597
Huh?


01:14:39.855 --> 01:14:44.860
Your face look a bit different.


01:14:46.862 --> 01:14:49.281
My eyes are weaker.


01:14:49.698 --> 01:14:52.659
I think it’s because I read under dim light.


01:14:54.119 --> 01:14:56.872
Eyes are the window to the soul.


01:14:57.998 --> 01:15:03.045
You have to watch out your face changing in a bad way.


01:15:04.755 --> 01:15:05.631
Okay.


01:15:07.257 --> 01:15:10.719
I want to become a proud father to you.


01:15:27.194 --> 01:15:29.738
I believe Su-yang is ready.


01:15:30.697 --> 01:15:39.164
If you face a foe like him head-on, you will undoubtably lose. We have to start soon.


01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:41.291
When?


01:15:41.583 --> 01:15:47.297
I’ll do it tomorrow after king’s banquet. Su-yang’s only weakness


01:15:47.297 --> 01:15:50.342
is having less experience than you.


01:15:51.426 --> 01:15:59.935
But he has a secret schemer who's very helpful to him. I have prepared a kid who looks like him.


01:16:01.562 --> 01:16:03.897
The body of the real king


01:16:04.606 --> 01:16:11.446
will be cut into 300 parts and dispersed in the mountains.


01:16:12.114 --> 01:16:15.242
Preemptive strike is the only answer.


01:16:17.035 --> 01:16:18.996
That’s the only way.


01:16:26.378 --> 01:16:28.380
This is my father’s writing.


01:16:28.922 --> 01:16:33.218
My father had told you to find a traitor by face reading?


01:16:34.803 --> 01:16:39.141
Isn’t this Prince Su-yang?


01:16:39.141 --> 01:16:43.020
Please look at that portrait of King Taejong.


01:16:44.521 --> 01:16:49.443
Doesn’t Su-yang look like him?


01:16:50.402 --> 01:16:52.738
What are you implying?


01:16:53.906 --> 01:16:56.950
Are you telling me just like my great-grandfather,


01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:59.161
my uncle will take the throne?


01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.082
Your Majesty. Take a look at Su-yang’s face.


01:17:04.082 --> 01:17:10.797
He has his grandfather’s strong desire for power.


01:17:11.048 --> 01:17:14.718
Face reading is a trivial matter.


01:17:14.968 --> 01:17:17.221
My father really believed in this?


01:17:18.263 --> 01:17:19.431
Your Majesty.


01:17:20.641 --> 01:17:24.937
Lord Kim, are you that afraid of Su-yang?


01:17:24.937 --> 01:17:29.441
It’s not a matter of being afraid. The whole country’s at stake.


01:17:29.858 --> 01:17:39.910
We’re not just telling you based on face reading. People can’t stop talking about Su-yang’s atrocious acts. You have to stop him immediately.


01:17:43.956 --> 01:17:48.126
My pawn is threatening your king.


01:17:52.214 --> 01:17:59.888
Nine o’clock! Nine o’clock!


01:18:03.934 --> 01:18:07.187
You’re leaving early for China tomorrow.


01:18:07.604 --> 01:18:08.605
Should we stop?


01:18:09.606 --> 01:18:13.569
It’ll be like a tour, don’t you worry.


01:18:17.155 --> 01:18:20.659
Excuse me while I use the restroom.


01:18:33.547 --> 01:18:37.301
Stick it in under the ear lobe.


01:18:39.219 --> 01:18:42.514
Don’t soil your hands, Prince. I'll Do it.


01:19:40.239 --> 01:19:43.951
Today Vice Premier Kim and Nae-kyeong came.


01:19:46.036 --> 01:19:52.376
They told me that you’re trying to dethrone me.


01:19:54.002 --> 01:19:56.088
Who can predict the future?


01:19:56.713 --> 01:20:00.425
They only know how to read faces.


01:20:01.385 --> 01:20:06.515
They don’t know what’s underneath. Nobody knows what’s underneath.


01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:10.018
Don’t listen to them.


01:20:10.602 --> 01:20:12.604
I don’t want to.


01:20:13.689 --> 01:20:19.736
I remember the friendly uncle who took care of me.


01:20:21.113 --> 01:20:25.784
I want to remember you like that.


01:20:26.326 --> 01:20:29.621
If it is my destiny to commit treason,


01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:38.881
I will change it with my free will.


01:20:55.397 --> 01:20:56.815
What is it?


01:20:57.566 --> 01:21:05.574
There was an order to switch at nine o’clock. - From whom? - Vice Premier Kim. Since when is he in charge of security?


01:21:05.782 --> 01:21:08.035
I asked him to do it.


01:21:08.785 --> 01:21:13.916
I thought the guards would be tired without a shift change.


01:21:15.918 --> 01:21:20.881
Please excuse me.


01:21:36.313 --> 01:21:38.440
A traitor’s face.


01:21:56.959 --> 01:22:01.463
Before Su-yang leaves for China, his soldiers were on standby near the palace.


01:22:01.797 --> 01:22:05.467
He was with the king until late.


01:22:06.677 --> 01:22:09.221
And I found this poison needle while searching the floor.


01:22:09.972 --> 01:22:13.934
This poison kills the victim by inducing a 10-day fever.


01:22:13.934 --> 01:22:18.480
He may be trying to divert the suspicion while he’s in China.


01:22:18.814 --> 01:22:21.859
He’s getting bold.


01:22:22.109 --> 01:22:28.156
It must be that schemer’s idea. We have to catch him while Su-yang’s away.


01:22:28.615 --> 01:22:32.369
But how? You said you only know his voice.


01:22:32.369 --> 01:22:34.621
Give me some of your men.


01:22:34.621 --> 01:22:37.749
I’ll comb through the city if needed.


01:22:38.584 --> 01:22:42.880
There are 3 suspicious figures under Su-yang.


01:22:43.172 --> 01:22:49.887
Ahn Kyeong-son is Su-yang’s personal guard.


01:22:50.554 --> 01:22:55.100
Lee Mong-ga, a love child of a court scholar,


01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:59.646
staying day and night at courtesan houses.


01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:05.485
Finally, a former royal guard, whose details aren’t clear.


01:23:05.485 --> 01:23:07.529
He quit a long time ago.


01:23:07.905 --> 01:23:10.282
Never visited again.


01:23:11.033 --> 01:23:14.620
But why look for the neck cripple?


01:23:14.912 --> 01:23:17.289
Has he done something?


01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:21.001
Neck cripple?


01:23:21.168 --> 01:23:22.998
He always does like this.


01:23:26.131 --> 01:23:27.716
What’s his name?


01:23:28.008 --> 01:23:29.801
His name is Han Myeong-hwoe.


01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:33.555
Han Myeong-hwoe.


01:23:36.767 --> 01:23:38.810
The prince’s not here. Get out!


01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:44.024
The schemer’s name is Han Myeong-hwoe. He’s been helping Su-yang for two years.


01:23:44.525 --> 01:23:49.404
Except for Su-yang, not many have seen his face.


01:23:49.738 --> 01:23:53.283
I may be able to find him by his voice alone.


01:23:56.578 --> 01:23:59.414
So much garbage here!


01:23:59.414 --> 01:24:01.792
Who’s Han Myeong-hwoe?


01:24:01.792 --> 01:24:03.627
There’s no such person!


01:24:03.627 --> 01:24:06.088
Find him if you can!


01:24:19.017 --> 01:24:20.727
Say something.


01:24:21.687 --> 01:24:22.604
Like what?


01:24:23.021 --> 01:24:25.607
Like a cry? ‘Did someone die?’


01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:28.151
Maybe a chicken cry?


01:24:34.741 --> 01:24:37.494
Cock-a-doodle-doo!


01:24:52.551 --> 01:24:58.432
The king is angry for causing a scene at Su-yang’s home.


01:24:58.932 --> 01:25:06.481
When I heard he was reading a book on face reading, I thought there was hope.


01:25:06.899 --> 01:25:11.987
But now he has sent all the doctors to Su-yang


01:25:11.987 --> 01:25:14.740
because he got sick on the road.


01:25:14.907 --> 01:25:19.411
Blood is thicker than water, indeed.


01:25:20.662 --> 01:25:22.331
Lord.


01:25:24.625 --> 01:25:26.543
What did you just say?


01:25:26.543 --> 01:25:31.924
Su-yang contracted a disease in China but it’s nothing serious.


01:25:32.341 --> 01:25:34.927
The king is reading a book on face reading?


01:25:37.429 --> 01:25:38.847
Yes.


01:25:56.990 --> 01:26:02.287
It’s the record of Han Dynasty, when treasons prevailed.


01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.633
This is it!


01:26:24.643 --> 01:26:27.271
Fire! Fire!


01:26:36.655 --> 01:26:38.156
Fire!


01:26:39.575 --> 01:26:41.535
You must’ve been tired.


01:26:41.785 --> 01:26:44.371
We heard your snoring from here.


01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:50.127
Snoring?


01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:53.797
Are you kidding me?


01:26:53.922 --> 01:27:00.762
I hear you can make beautiful moles.


01:27:05.767 --> 01:27:08.604
You want me to go with you


01:27:08.604 --> 01:27:12.524
and put a mole on Su-yang’s face?


01:27:17.362 --> 01:27:20.866
You seriously think I’d help you?


01:27:22.034 --> 01:27:25.162
Yes. Why?


01:27:27.456 --> 01:27:29.244
You remember this?


01:27:30.918 --> 01:27:33.378
It’s our partnership contract.


01:27:34.838 --> 01:27:36.089
So what?


01:27:36.381 --> 01:27:41.053
If I get caught while messing up Su-yang’s face,


01:27:41.553 --> 01:27:45.140
I could say my partner ordered me to do it.


01:27:46.683 --> 01:27:48.393
What would happen then?


01:28:09.289 --> 01:28:11.416
Is it hot in here?


01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.216
Give it to me, you ass!


01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:23.804
Please I beg you!


01:28:27.057 --> 01:28:30.102
What are they doing?


01:28:46.785 --> 01:28:50.831
Do you know Vice Premier Kim?


01:28:51.248 --> 01:28:54.209
I respect him very much.


01:28:54.209 --> 01:28:58.046
People with yellow tags are hired because it means


01:28:58.046 --> 01:29:02.759
Kim Jong-seo recommended them.


01:29:02.759 --> 01:29:09.808
You have to tell him to stop this nonsense with yellow tags.


01:29:09.808 --> 01:29:14.646
If we do that, it’ll only make Su-yang happy.


01:29:15.355 --> 01:29:20.694
It’s unavoidable to stop Su-yang!


01:29:22.779 --> 01:29:31.371
The prince will be attended by outside doctors. The royal physician may leave now.


01:29:48.472 --> 01:29:49.515
Are you new?


01:29:50.057 --> 01:29:51.558
Yes.


01:30:02.277 --> 01:30:05.405
The security’s tight.


01:30:08.075 --> 01:30:11.161
You look perfect. You fit the part.


01:30:13.247 --> 01:30:17.960
If this is my path to afterlife, I’ll haunt you forever.


01:30:23.549 --> 01:30:24.925
Ouch!


01:30:49.283 --> 01:30:51.076
Once he inhales this,


01:30:51.076 --> 01:30:53.912
he’ll feel no pain and remember nothing.


01:30:53.912 --> 01:30:56.665
But it’ll only last for a short time.


01:30:56.665 --> 01:30:59.835
If we don’t finish until this incense is burned,


01:31:01.587 --> 01:31:05.257
we’ll all be killed.


01:31:59.102 --> 01:32:00.979
Are you blind?


01:32:05.526 --> 01:32:07.778
This part!


01:33:30.903 --> 01:33:32.446
Hey, hey!


01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:36.783
- We’re finished! - All done!


01:34:10.442 --> 01:34:13.362
I almost died.


01:34:14.613 --> 01:34:17.032
I had to pee so badly.


01:34:17.616 --> 01:34:19.868
I can’t stop peeing.


01:34:26.708 --> 01:34:31.713
I was raised in the courtesan house since the age of 5.


01:34:32.464 --> 01:34:41.056
Tiniest mistake could lead to beatings, so I learned how to read people to survive.


01:34:41.557 --> 01:34:46.270
That’s how I became the owner of the biggest courtesan house.


01:34:51.567 --> 01:34:53.944
You’re better at face reading.


01:34:53.944 --> 01:34:56.655
But I think I’m better at reading people.


01:34:57.489 --> 01:34:59.694
Do you think this will stop the revolt?


01:35:02.077 --> 01:35:03.370
It has to.


01:35:08.292 --> 01:35:10.502
If it works out, don’t forget me.


01:35:11.879 --> 01:35:13.881
If it doesn’t, forget me.


01:35:23.724 --> 01:35:24.725
So...


01:35:26.018 --> 01:35:27.019
Who is it?


01:35:27.019 --> 01:35:30.439
Who wrote about the Vice Premier’s yellow tag?


01:35:35.194 --> 01:35:36.278
Alright.


01:35:36.987 --> 01:35:40.699
Tell me more about it.


01:35:43.785 --> 01:35:49.917
Earlier, I saw an official tagging himself.


01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:56.256
Back when he was an inspector, he extorted money from the locals


01:35:58.550 --> 01:36:01.261
and stole people’s wives.


01:36:02.221 --> 01:36:06.767
Yellow tag could be useful if it’s used right,


01:36:08.852 --> 01:36:11.355
but it also has many problems.


01:36:13.982 --> 01:36:21.156
I’m glad someone came forward to tell me about this.


01:36:23.408 --> 01:36:27.120
I believe something must be done.


01:36:30.582 --> 01:36:32.626
About Vice Premier Kim.


01:36:33.585 --> 01:36:37.381
He recommends people with yellow tags


01:36:38.131 --> 01:36:42.386
and talks behind your back.


01:36:42.678 --> 01:36:46.890
That’s because you’re too nice to him.


01:36:47.182 --> 01:36:49.351
My father trusted him.


01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:51.562
That’s why I...


01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.407
Are you okay?


01:37:03.824 --> 01:37:05.200
It’s nothing.


01:37:06.201 --> 01:37:10.747
The sun was too strong.


01:37:19.339 --> 01:37:21.466
Qin Xi of Zhao State took over the throne


01:37:23.635 --> 01:37:25.429
by starting a coup,


01:37:26.513 --> 01:37:30.225
after 3 moles appeared on his forehead.


01:37:30.726 --> 01:37:40.861
He has his grandfather’s strong desire for power. People can’t stop talking about Su-yang’s atrocious acts. Since when is he in charge of security?


01:37:49.703 --> 01:37:54.666
Who ordered you to guard me?


01:37:56.585 --> 01:37:58.045
It’s...


01:37:58.462 --> 01:38:00.797
Tell me now.


01:38:01.548 --> 01:38:05.719
Prince Su-yang ordered me.


01:38:13.435 --> 01:38:15.437
I was blind.


01:38:16.063 --> 01:38:18.565
I’m surrounded by Su-yang’s men.


01:38:19.191 --> 01:38:21.610
I can’t let his men watch over me.


01:38:22.194 --> 01:38:23.320
Exile him.


01:38:27.741 --> 01:38:31.119
We can’t make a mistake.


01:38:31.828 --> 01:38:35.791
Tomorrow when Su-yang’s men escort the Chinese envoy,


01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:38.752
we will strike him.


01:38:39.670 --> 01:38:47.922
He’s giving a reception to the envoy right now. Make sure this does not leak.


01:38:52.432 --> 01:38:54.393
Nae-kyeong, Nae-kyeong.


01:38:54.768 --> 01:38:57.312
Will he give you an important position?


01:38:57.312 --> 01:39:00.315
Did he promise?


01:39:02.943 --> 01:39:06.363
You didn’t even ask?


01:39:06.363 --> 01:39:08.532
Of course you didn’t.


01:39:09.783 --> 01:39:12.828
I’ll ask when things die down.


01:39:13.495 --> 01:39:18.500
I’m sure Lord Kim could give Jin-hyeong a good position.


01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:21.378
You have to ask before you offer to help.


01:39:21.378 --> 01:39:25.799
You never know what might happen.


01:39:27.009 --> 01:39:28.385
It’s ready.


01:39:30.137 --> 01:39:31.680
Here.


01:39:33.724 --> 01:39:35.434
Is this good for eyes?


01:39:35.809 --> 01:39:39.938
I need mums from that mountain. They work the best.


01:39:40.397 --> 01:39:48.238
But I hurt my back and can’t climb the mountain. So I used the next best thing. It’ll work pretty well.


01:39:49.364 --> 01:39:51.325
When will your back improve?


01:39:51.325 --> 01:39:54.244
After a couple of days.


01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:01.376
What is this?


01:40:04.671 --> 01:40:07.090
These are old matters.


01:40:07.424 --> 01:40:12.346
You don’t have to worry about it. Say it now!


01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:17.893
Who told the king about the yellow tags?


01:40:24.608 --> 01:40:27.069
Mr. Kim from the Inspection Board left this for you.


01:40:31.365 --> 01:40:32.741
Here.


01:40:39.706 --> 01:40:42.292
I’m proud that you were promoted.


01:40:42.626 --> 01:40:45.170
Take this. It’s good for your eyes.


01:40:45.963 --> 01:40:51.677
It’d have been nice to see him since we were there.


01:40:52.052 --> 01:40:55.389
I didn’t want him to feel uncomfortable.


01:40:56.515 --> 01:40:59.351
I hope the medicine works well.


01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:01.353
Where are you going?


01:41:01.937 --> 01:41:05.607
Going to get some mums.


01:41:06.567 --> 01:41:08.861
I want the best for him.


01:41:08.861 --> 01:41:11.697
Let’s go together.


01:41:12.114 --> 01:41:13.740
No need.


01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:57.326
How dare you talk about the Vice Premier like that?


01:41:57.618 --> 01:42:00.329
Kid, you know nothing.


01:42:01.371 --> 01:42:05.918
You’ll shut your mouth when you can’t see anything.


01:42:15.093 --> 01:42:16.762
Is Mr. Kim here?


01:42:17.638 --> 01:42:19.014
Mr. Kim?


01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:24.228
He’s out...


01:42:25.938 --> 01:42:26.855
What’s wrong?


01:42:27.105 --> 01:42:30.192
A young man in Saganwon hurt his eyes badly.


01:42:30.692 --> 01:42:32.486
He wants to see Mr. Kim.


01:42:32.486 --> 01:42:35.030
A young man in Saganwon...


01:42:36.073 --> 01:42:37.699
You mean Jin-hyeong?


01:42:39.117 --> 01:42:41.036
Jin-hyeong hurt his eyes?


01:42:45.999 --> 01:42:49.086
Right eye’s gone.


01:42:49.086 --> 01:42:51.463
The left one’s bad too.


01:42:52.047 --> 01:42:53.799
Will he lose his sight?


01:42:53.799 --> 01:42:54.800
Yes.


01:42:56.593 --> 01:42:58.512
Jin-hyeong!


01:43:01.348 --> 01:43:03.183
What happened?


01:43:04.184 --> 01:43:05.602
Uncle.


01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:09.231
Yes, it’s me. What happened?


01:43:09.606 --> 01:43:13.235
Where’s father? I want to see him.


01:43:19.408 --> 01:43:24.371
Where are you, father! Stay back!


01:43:25.330 --> 01:43:27.791
Please.


01:43:31.503 --> 01:43:36.210
Please fix his eyes!


01:43:39.928 --> 01:43:42.431
What happened?


01:43:42.431 --> 01:43:46.393
I heard Kim Jong-seo ordered this.


01:43:46.935 --> 01:43:50.981
He got pissed that kid told the king about the yellow tags.


01:43:50.981 --> 01:43:54.228
No way he’d harm a kid like that!


01:43:55.194 --> 01:43:58.488
I heard them talking.


01:43:59.072 --> 01:44:02.326
They said they were Kim’s men.


01:44:02.868 --> 01:44:07.456
And Kim’ll put his grandson in his position.


01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.126
Jin-hyeong.


01:44:12.836 --> 01:44:17.799
Get up early tomorrow before your father and leave for Hanyang.


01:44:18.383 --> 01:44:19.635
What?


01:44:20.219 --> 01:44:22.012
Go find the peddler I know.


01:44:22.012 --> 01:44:24.389
He’ll lend you a new name.


01:44:24.389 --> 01:44:28.018
Study hard and get a job as you wish.


01:44:33.815 --> 01:44:36.610
You can even become a minister.


01:44:37.694 --> 01:44:38.737
You know that?


01:44:53.877 --> 01:44:54.753
Who’s there?


01:45:03.595 --> 01:45:07.432
I came to see Prince Su-yang.


01:45:17.609 --> 01:45:20.320
Kim Nae-kyeong’s brother-in-law is here.


01:45:36.378 --> 01:45:38.630
Why are you here?


01:45:40.549 --> 01:45:42.593
Don’t send your men away tomorrow.


01:45:44.511 --> 01:45:45.679
What?


01:45:46.471 --> 01:45:52.102
Don’t escort the Chinese envoy.


01:45:52.936 --> 01:45:58.358
Kim Jong-seo will kill you while your men are away.


01:46:04.865 --> 01:46:07.409
Why are you telling me this?


01:46:08.410 --> 01:46:11.622
I heard you made a promise to my brother.


01:46:12.497 --> 01:46:14.917
Please...


01:46:17.044 --> 01:46:19.838
Keep that promise.


01:46:20.005 --> 01:46:28.555
Please restore our family’s name and offer a position to my brother-in-law


01:46:30.432 --> 01:46:33.477
and my nephew.


01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:41.193
That’s all I ask.


01:46:41.818 --> 01:46:43.320
Prince Su-yang.


01:46:43.904 --> 01:46:46.782
Your highness, I beg you.


01:46:58.168 --> 01:46:59.795
I promise.


01:47:03.173 --> 01:47:04.758
I promise.


01:47:34.413 --> 01:47:37.207
We’d have fallen for their tricks.


01:47:37.708 --> 01:47:41.170
How did you know he’d come if that kid was hurt?


01:47:41.795 --> 01:47:44.798
Who could’ve predicted that?


01:47:45.632 --> 01:47:48.552
I thought Kim Nae-kyeong would come.


01:47:59.229 --> 01:48:04.276
What did you just say?


01:48:07.738 --> 01:48:11.658
I said all we have to do is wait.


01:48:12.618 --> 01:48:16.538
He will fix Jin-hyeong’s eyes


01:48:17.497 --> 01:48:19.917
and give him a good post.


01:48:48.695 --> 01:48:51.406
Wake up!


01:48:53.534 --> 01:48:55.244
Kim Jong-seo...


01:48:55.244 --> 01:48:59.289
He doesn’t care about people like us.


01:48:59.706 --> 01:49:05.587
He put his grandson in Jin-hyeong’s place!


01:49:17.349 --> 01:49:21.645
We’ll all die!


01:49:22.396 --> 01:49:26.316
If Kim dies, we’re all dead too!


01:49:47.671 --> 01:49:51.341
I have to stop them. Or everyone will perish!


01:51:05.624 --> 01:51:07.292
Lord Kim!


01:51:13.215 --> 01:51:15.259
Vice Premier.


01:51:16.552 --> 01:51:22.349
Welcome. We have much to discuss, let’s go inside.


01:51:22.683 --> 01:51:24.678
Vice Premier.


01:51:28.063 --> 01:51:29.815
You have to run.


01:51:29.815 --> 01:51:33.610
Run? What do you mean?


01:51:39.867 --> 01:51:42.703
Where have you been?


01:51:45.539 --> 01:51:47.916
Why are you here at this hour?


01:51:53.172 --> 01:51:56.633
I lost my hat string on my way.


01:51:57.384 --> 01:52:00.888
I was wondering if I could borrow one.


01:52:01.221 --> 01:52:06.435
I think you could survive without a hat string for a night.


01:52:06.685 --> 01:52:08.896
I need to go somewhere.


01:52:09.521 --> 01:52:14.026
I don’t think they will like my hat without a string.


01:52:19.281 --> 01:52:21.116
Bring a hat string.


01:52:41.136 --> 01:52:47.726
You look like you’d live a long life till seventy.


01:52:51.188 --> 01:52:53.148
How old are you?


01:52:58.403 --> 01:53:00.614
Seventy this year.


01:53:01.365 --> 01:53:05.911
I have a wish this year.


01:53:13.794 --> 01:53:15.879
What is it?


01:53:18.257 --> 01:53:20.467
To become a king.


01:53:24.012 --> 01:53:26.390
What is this?!


01:54:56.939 --> 01:54:59.191
Su-yang, you bastard!


01:55:00.692 --> 01:55:03.529
Who do you think you are?


01:55:40.732 --> 01:55:42.776
My lord!


01:55:46.029 --> 01:55:48.407
The tiger hunt is over.


01:55:59.084 --> 01:56:04.214
Su-yang killed Kim Jong-seo!


01:56:05.424 --> 01:56:10.679
Su-yang killed Kim Jong-seo! Su-yang...


01:56:14.224 --> 01:56:17.477
killed Kim Jong-seo!


01:56:19.354 --> 01:56:24.610
Gather your men and arrest Su-yang.


01:56:24.610 --> 01:56:28.322
If we’re late we can’t stop the revolt.


01:56:28.697 --> 01:56:31.992
Who says that? Who are you?


01:56:35.162 --> 01:56:37.748
Who else?


01:56:37.748 --> 01:56:41.627
It’s the famous face reader.


01:56:45.088 --> 01:56:47.799
Kim Nae-kyeong.


01:56:47.799 --> 01:56:50.010
How have you been?


01:56:51.762 --> 01:56:53.472
Han Myeong-hwoe.


01:56:55.849 --> 01:57:02.105
You all committed treason...


01:57:02.689 --> 01:57:04.399
All thanks to you.


01:57:09.154 --> 01:57:11.031
You bastards!


01:57:11.490 --> 01:57:13.492
You’ll be doomed.


01:57:13.909 --> 01:57:15.994
Burn in hell!


01:57:17.329 --> 01:57:20.249
I’ll show you what hell is.


01:57:24.545 --> 01:57:27.798
Premier Hwang Bo-in is here.


01:57:29.508 --> 01:57:33.262
Who are you? Have you enjoyed life?


01:58:11.925 --> 01:58:15.470
Did you want me exiled?


01:58:16.513 --> 01:58:21.018
If you have succeeded I’d be dead by now.


01:58:22.186 --> 01:58:24.771
That’s power.


01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:27.316
Either I die.


01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:30.944
Or my enemy dies.


01:58:32.487 --> 01:58:45.167
Three premiers have been killed for manipulating the king. From now on I will control the premiers, ministry of administration, and ministry of justice.


01:58:45.167 --> 01:58:52.549
I’ll also take control of the army to protect the king. If you support me,


01:58:54.176 --> 01:58:56.178
line up here.


01:58:56.803 --> 01:59:01.475
If you don’t, you’ll be executed.


01:59:20.744 --> 01:59:27.501
We will not be able to undo this atrocious act.


01:59:28.502 --> 01:59:31.755
But I beg you. Please be a good king


01:59:32.381 --> 01:59:35.968
and rule your subjects kindly.


02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:27.811
I have to report to the king


02:00:27.811 --> 02:00:29.938
that I took care of all his enemy.


02:00:30.689 --> 02:00:32.733
You can go back now.


02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:43.827
Su-yang killed Kim Jong-seo!


02:00:44.244 --> 02:00:46.705
The world has changed!


02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:51.502
He’s killing everyone who’s against him.


02:00:51.502 --> 02:00:54.838
All the officials are being arrested.


02:00:59.301 --> 02:01:01.254
Jin-hyeong...


02:01:02.763 --> 02:01:08.060
These are Su-yang’s enemies.


02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:10.729
Everyone will be executed.


02:01:10.729 --> 02:01:12.356
Walk straight!


02:01:17.402 --> 02:01:18.820
Jin-hyeong!


02:01:20.614 --> 02:01:21.740
Jin-hyeong!


02:01:22.115 --> 02:01:23.242
Jin-hyeong!


02:01:23.825 --> 02:01:25.285
Jin-hyeong!


02:01:27.037 --> 02:01:28.163
It’s your father!


02:01:28.163 --> 02:01:30.958
I’m here! Jin-hyeong!


02:01:31.708 --> 02:01:32.793
Nae-kyeong!


02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:35.504
Nae-kyeong!


02:01:35.671 --> 02:01:38.298
Jin-hyeong! Jin-hyeong!


02:01:44.221 --> 02:01:45.305
Jin-hyeong!


02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:49.810
Your highness!


02:01:50.143 --> 02:01:51.895
Your highness!


02:01:51.895 --> 02:01:55.308
Prince Su-yang! Prince Su-yang...


02:01:56.024 --> 02:01:59.278
Prince Su-yang! Prince Su-yang...


02:01:59.278 --> 02:02:00.279
please let him live!


02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.866
That’s my son. Please let him live.


02:02:05.868 --> 02:02:07.619
Where is your son?


02:02:07.619 --> 02:02:10.873
That one over there is my son.


02:02:10.873 --> 02:02:12.291
He’s just a kid.


02:02:12.291 --> 02:02:15.002
Please save him, your highness.


02:02:20.924 --> 02:02:22.801
Jin-hyeong!


02:02:22.801 --> 02:02:27.306
- Are you okay? - Father? Don’t worry. Don’t worry.


02:02:29.433 --> 02:02:30.642
Jin-hyeong.


02:02:32.603 --> 02:02:34.396
Is he your son?


02:02:34.855 --> 02:02:37.608
Yes, he is.


02:02:37.608 --> 02:02:39.860
He was not on my side.


02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:42.237
He’s an idiot.


02:02:42.821 --> 02:02:44.198
He’s just a kid.


02:02:44.656 --> 02:02:47.743
Then can I take your eyes


02:02:49.077 --> 02:02:52.247
for forgiving your son?


02:02:53.665 --> 02:02:55.083
Yes, you can.


02:02:55.709 --> 02:02:57.377
Please take my eyes!


02:02:57.711 --> 02:03:00.172
Father, no!


02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:02.090
Father!


02:03:02.090 --> 02:03:06.136
You heard him. Gouge out his arrogant eyes!


02:03:06.512 --> 02:03:08.388
No! Father, no!


02:03:45.592 --> 02:03:47.386
Leave it that.


02:03:47.386 --> 02:03:50.013
Why would I need your eyes?


02:04:04.736 --> 02:04:09.658
Instead, I want you to read my face.


02:04:18.166 --> 02:04:21.753
So, am I fit to be a king?


02:04:23.797 --> 02:04:26.341
Still can’t tell?


02:04:28.343 --> 02:04:29.887
No.


02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:31.805
No.


02:04:33.307 --> 02:04:34.600
Your highness,


02:04:35.309 --> 02:04:37.269
will become a king.


02:04:38.312 --> 02:04:40.272
You will become a great king


02:04:40.272 --> 02:04:42.608
who will make this country stronger.


02:04:43.483 --> 02:04:46.111
You will go down in history


02:04:46.111 --> 02:04:49.239
as the greatest king, your highness!


02:04:59.499 --> 02:05:03.712
That makes me feel good.


02:05:05.714 --> 02:05:07.674
Let’s finish here.


02:05:08.509 --> 02:05:09.801
Go now.


02:05:15.224 --> 02:05:17.726
Are you okay, father?


02:05:18.101 --> 02:05:20.979
It’s okay, Jin-hyeong.


02:05:25.692 --> 02:05:28.487
It’s all over.


02:05:30.113 --> 02:05:32.449
Let’s go home now.


02:05:32.824 --> 02:05:35.494
Back to where we came from.


02:05:37.079 --> 02:05:39.289
Hey, face reader!


02:05:43.085 --> 02:05:45.671
Actually it’s weird.


02:05:46.421 --> 02:05:50.384
I’m already the king. Why did you say I’ll become one?


02:05:50.717 --> 02:05:52.386
Aren’t you a crook?


02:05:52.678 --> 02:05:55.639
You should’ve said that before I became the king.


02:05:55.848 --> 02:05:58.809
Anybody can say what you just said.


02:06:00.811 --> 02:06:05.107
But since I asked, I should pay.


02:07:11.924 --> 02:07:13.467
Jin-hyeong!


02:07:30.234 --> 02:07:33.904
No, no! Jin-hyeong!


02:07:35.531 --> 02:07:44.122
Father, save me... Jin-hyeong!


02:07:52.297 --> 02:07:55.008
I should’ve killed you


02:07:55.759 --> 02:07:58.887
but since you helped me I’m letting you live.


02:08:31.587 --> 02:08:34.339
Jin-hyeong!


02:09:18.967 --> 02:09:25.390
Did he know his son would die at a young age?


02:09:27.935 --> 02:09:30.062
I sure didn’t.


02:10:01.385 --> 02:10:03.512
Hey!


02:10:09.184 --> 02:10:11.603
How have you been?


02:10:13.689 --> 02:10:18.610
I remember him being very talkative.


02:10:19.987 --> 02:10:24.867
Because of guilt he cut his throat.


02:10:24.867 --> 02:10:27.327
He survived but lost his voice.


02:10:37.171 --> 02:10:42.009
I didn’t want to tell him. But I didn’t have a choice.


02:10:48.015 --> 02:10:50.058
Step back!


02:11:09.745 --> 02:11:11.580
It’s nice.


02:11:11.580 --> 02:11:15.167
The sea breeze is fine.


02:11:15.667 --> 02:11:20.088
But isn’t this a place for retirement?


02:11:20.088 --> 02:11:22.925
It’s too peaceful.


02:11:24.426 --> 02:11:29.348
I don’t think you fit here.


02:11:34.269 --> 02:11:41.068
Have you recorded all the faces of the revolters?


02:11:43.529 --> 02:11:45.405
Write them down.


02:11:46.406 --> 02:11:50.410
It’ll be useful to remember all the details


02:11:50.410 --> 02:11:54.081
of those who enjoy wars.


02:11:54.414 --> 02:11:58.877
You think all of you had special faces that day?


02:11:59.545 --> 02:12:02.673
I saw faces of swindlers,


02:12:04.049 --> 02:12:07.761
faces of butchers,


02:12:09.471 --> 02:12:12.224
faces of scholars.


02:12:12.224 --> 02:12:14.810
They were just normal faces.


02:12:15.394 --> 02:12:17.145
What then?


02:12:17.145 --> 02:12:23.026
I’m saying, Su-yang meant be be the king. What?


02:12:24.528 --> 02:12:27.197
I only saw faces.


02:12:27.197 --> 02:12:29.366
I didn’t see the changing era.


02:12:29.992 --> 02:12:32.995
I only saw the waves.


02:12:34.413 --> 02:12:36.665
I should have seen the wind.


02:12:37.708 --> 02:12:40.252
Wind is what makes the waves.


02:12:43.463 --> 02:12:49.094
You’re saying nothing could have stopped our coup?


02:12:49.428 --> 02:12:52.514
I’m saying you were on the big wave at that moment.


02:12:52.514 --> 02:12:55.434
We were drifting away.


02:12:56.059 --> 02:12:58.896
One day we’ll go up again.


02:13:00.814 --> 02:13:03.817
Eventually the big wave will break down.


02:13:04.484 --> 02:13:06.570
Are you cursing me?


02:13:12.618 --> 02:13:15.120
This is the first time I see your face clearly.


02:13:21.001 --> 02:13:22.544
It’s a weird face.


02:13:22.794 --> 02:13:25.881
It looks shallow and yet noble.


02:13:27.007 --> 02:13:30.302
But, you have a bad ending.


02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:33.138
You...


02:13:35.098 --> 02:13:38.101
will be beheaded.


02:13:57.913 --> 02:14:00.999
Time flies.


02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:04.795
Everything seems like yesterday.


02:14:05.420 --> 02:14:08.131
I’m so old now.


02:14:09.758 --> 02:14:17.474
After that, I did my best to


02:14:18.725 --> 02:14:21.436
not make any enemies.


02:14:22.312 --> 02:14:24.606
Maybe that’s why.


02:14:25.482 --> 02:14:29.528
Su-yang died 20 years ago.


02:14:30.487 --> 02:14:34.408
And I’ve served four kings.


02:14:37.202 --> 02:14:39.872
You were right.


02:14:40.581 --> 02:14:44.918
Face reading is a superstition.


02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:50.090
I didn’t get beheaded.


02:14:53.552 --> 02:14:57.764
He was wrong after all.


02:15:49.107 --> 02:15:51.193
What are you looking at?


02:15:53.529 --> 02:15:55.656
The world.


02:15:57.991 --> 02:16:01.370
How is the world?
