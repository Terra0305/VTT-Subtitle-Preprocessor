1
00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:08.569
With tensions rising over the protracted suspension of the National Assembly..

2
00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:23.817
It’ll be decided after tomorrow’s ruling-opposition summit. What a pathetic bunch..

3
00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:30.090
Have they no shame in wasting taxpayers’ money? The proposed presidential pardon is stirring things up.

4
00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.625
How come it’s in the papers before anything’s even been decided?

5
00:01:54.648 --> 00:02:05.626
“If I win, I’ll make all the donations”. I don’t have long left in my tenure. Do I have to attend all these events?

6
00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:51.405
Would you look at that? A President marking lottery numbers.. Pathetic! I’ll make a note of that, sir. President Kim wished success in hosting the World Cup and for happiness of fellow Koreans.. This is good. I made it spicier than usual. I thought you had a quite a few drinks at dinner last night. Russians love a drink, don’t they? Maybe this is why they tried to change the law. To enjoy the tasty foods for longer. Dictators must have had the best chefs.

7
00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:35.582
Do they expect me to do their job for the entire year? Cha is not an easy man. It won’t hurt to be prepared.

8
00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:41.221
What’s on tonight’s agenda? The presidential pardon, sir. We advise you to reconsider.

9
00:03:48.695 --> 00:04:11.084
personal forgiveness. The nation and our recent history isn’t ready to forgive them. Moreover, there is the outstanding issue of an unaccounted-for slush fund. The public sentiment remains strong. You might take the fall for your generosity. What are your thoughts, Minister?

10
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:43.617
Do you think I’m going over the line, too? I was the chief justice for the case. They were tried as former Presidents and there was huge pressure. But, be it death penalty or life imprisonment. Sentencing them was only possible because the public approved. I believe you should approach this issue from that perspective.

11
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:54.328
I’m the President of this country. A special pardon is the President’s right under the Constitution. Am I mistaken? No, it’s not unlawful, sir.

12
00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:21.855
What’s all that? I have a big presentation at the seminar. Couldn’t you have gotten a cab? Why spend money on a cab?

13
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.495
This car was given to me for official duty not for picking up husbands. All right, all right..

14
00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:44.144
Take the presidential pardon for instance.. Would it have been possible earlier in his tenure? We’re dancing around the same topic. Let’s not distort his good intentions. -Turn up the volume, please? -Yes, ma’am.

15
00:05:44.244 --> 00:06:40.234
The current President was persecuted by the military government. In other words, he was the biggest victim. Why would he want to do this? To fulfill one of this government’s greatest objectives - to unite the nation. What about the slush fund? Please approach the subject more logically. Please let me speak.. We deeply regret that, too. It’s up to the judiciary bodies to investigate the matter fully. But, how do you expect the justice department to do a proper job when the government is clearly lacking the will. Are you accusing us of undermining the principles of division of powers? In this day and age? What’s the point of convicting and sentencing them to life in prison when they are let off right away? What’s the point of giving them the death penalty, only to free them after a year and a half? It was 2 years. Get your facts right. It was 20 months to be precise!

16
00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:55.349
How have you been, sir? You look more handsome than ever. They’re referring to you as the JFK of Korea.

17
00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.050
That must be an exaggeration, surely.

18
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:21.175
Shall we get a beer? Excuse me? Isn’t it a bit early? Don’t be shy, young man.

19
00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:27.981
Come and sit over here.

20
00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.964
Let’s pass this one.

21
00:07:49.536 --> 00:08:05.485
All bills are important. Instead, I’ll let you have this one.. the revised Civil Service Law. We can’t be sloppy with these. It’s urgent, son. We gotta make decisions fast so that people can get on with their lives.

22
00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:08.622
Will you stop calling me “son”?

23
00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:11.491
You know how many times I changed your dirty diapers?

24
00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:18.031
All right, all right. Let’s move on. You have always been so illogical.

25
00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:36.884
E-yeon is coming back from school this year.

26
00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:49.396
So, what? Just letting you know.

27
00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:54.534
She’s well over thirty and still studying?

28
00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:02.276
That’s what I’m talking about.

29
00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:40.147
Are you trying to scare me with a stare? Guard! Did she say that? That I dated her? Your father did! That you were chasing after her. That’s just ridiculous! Study was my only focus. I can get the NIS to look into it. Don’t lie to me. I can’t believe this.

30
00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:43.283
You would use the agency’s service for personal reasons? Do you know what year we’re living in?

31
00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:53.894
That would call for impeachment. Hey. This one.. the Capital Administration Bill. Let me have it. What do you mean let you have it?! I shouldn’t have come by myself.

32
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:36.770
It went very well. Although we didn’t manage to go over all outstanding bills. But, we had umm.. better results than initially anticipated from the marathon meeting.

33
00:10:42.042 --> 00:11:04.031
Forgive me for telling you this in a letter. found out why my family disapproved of us so ardently. Honey, come and watch this Mimi dies tonight. They still don’t know that they have the same father? They know now.

34
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:23.183
I’m your host of tonight’s draw, Lucky Bae! We’re coming to you live with the first draw of the World Cup Lottery.. Has the battery run out? We’ll start the draw right away.

35
00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:38.732
Spin the balls! The numbers have to be in the order they appear on your screen. Ladies and gentlemen, the first lucky number is.. 6!

36
00:11:46.540 --> 00:12:13.333
Why your eyes look like mine, why your fingers look like mine, I’ll tell you now. The third number is.. It’s “0”! The fourth lucky number is.. 2! With two numbers remaining.. The fifth lucky number is.. 1!

37
00:12:21.842 --> 00:13:06.153
-And, the last number that will determine tonight’s lucky winner.. My mother who passed away when I was young, is your mother. Who will be the lucky winner of 24.4 billion Won? Mimi, you’re my sister! It’s number “9”!

38
00:13:11.825 --> 00:14:08.982
an ambulance entered the Blue House around 9 o’clock this evening and rushed directly to SNU Hospital. President Kim is reported to have no particular health conditions other than slightly high blood pressure and angina. It is suspected that stress from the marathon meeting earlier may have been the cause. How did it happen? He was watching a soap opera before he collapsed. A soap opera? Why would the President collapse over Mimi finding her father? The President is taking a rest after suffering from dizziness. The 4 leaders of the opposition and ruling party are convening an emergency meeting. Also, the Blue House will proceed with firm countermeasures against any press or individuals who circulate malignant rumors.. The Army will be fully prepared for any potential enemy attacks..

39
00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:16.557
It’s very fortunate that he didn’t suffer a concussion.

40
00:15:06.773 --> 00:15:13.113
..this drama series is so addictive.

41
00:15:17.651 --> 00:15:21.755
We have a car ready for you in the basement car park. It’s crowded with reporters outside.

42
00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:25.092
Thank you. This way, ma’am.

43
00:16:25.986 --> 00:16:31.525
Can you hear me, honey? Honey!

44
00:16:33.327 --> 00:16:36.597
Can you hear me, sir?

45
00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:27.548
He wants his wallet!!!

46
00:17:31.552 --> 00:17:57.311
at 8:30 this morning and asked for his wallet as the first thing. The President opened the wallet with trembling hands and looked at the old photograph of himself and the First Lady in tears, according to an aide present at the scene. President Kim is a true family man who thought of his family first, in the face of imminent death.

47
00:17:58.979 --> 00:18:00.747
We’re lucky to have him as our President.

48
00:18:42.389 --> 00:19:07.347
And, goal!!!!! Korea wins the match! Ladies and gentlemen, tonight’s match, truly an unscripted drama, ends with a spectacular last-minute goal from Ahn!

49
00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:28.202
They told me you stayed up by my bedside. What’s with the fuss? You mustn’t stay out all night being a single dad.

50
00:19:29.436 --> 00:19:34.408
It’s not like I didn’t have a place to crash. I was worried about you.

51
00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:36.743
You owe me a drink.

52
00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:50.424
How come? I collapsed at a perfect time for you. Because of what happened, the public will want a young and healthy President. Give it your best shot in the upcoming election.

53
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.327
You may not have wisdom but you have a good health.

54
00:20:03.303 --> 00:20:27.227
House, 3 billion. Wife.. 2 and for daughter.. 1? Travel.. 0.5.

55
00:20:28.362 --> 00:20:43.710
No.. 1 is more like it. I think it’s best for you to take a few more days off. This might be too much of a strain right now. There’s no need to clear the schedule. I’m good. No need to worry.

56
00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:59.259
It’s a made-to-order model equipped with tons of high-tech devices. About 1 billion Won? Rather pricey.

57
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:09.670
Will they give it to me when I step down? It’s for the use of the President only. But, you’ll be provided with another vehicle.

58
00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:17.311
They’re being cheap. In that case, I’ll just buy one for myself. Car.. 1 billion.

59
00:21:34.995 --> 00:21:56.049
When is 6 months from now? 6 months from now is.. February. Precisely, it’s two days before the Inauguration ..MUST BE CLAIMED AT THE DESIGNATED BANK WITHIN 6 MONTHS..

60
00:21:57.417 --> 00:22:12.366
If I won the lottery, I would make donations, in fact, I’ll spend it all on my fellow Koreans.

61
00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:42.029
We should have made him change his schedule. Why can’t you take it easy like other retiring Presidents? You’ll end up in the national cemetery before the Inauguration.

62
00:23:00.681 --> 00:23:14.761
For the purpose of improving the national brand of Korea, it’ll be imperative to allocate the extra budget funds and resources required for updating the system.

63
00:23:15.596 --> 00:23:19.666
And, of course..

64
00:23:47.528 --> 00:23:58.472
By providing training programs and educational literature for the tourism sector, and attracting fluent speakers of foreign languages.. Daddy!

65
00:25:11.345 --> 00:26:09.803
Please take a number slip, sir. Well, actually.. I’m here for the lottery.. In any case, take a number slip and wait for your turn, sir. Don’t jump the line, old man! But, I’m here for the lottery.. If you want to buy a lotto ticket, go to a corner shop. In the bank, you should take a slip.. Well, I need help with the vault. If you want to rob the vault you should come at night. If you want to do it during office hours get yourself a number slip! Is that so hard, old man? How dare you talk to me like that? I won the lottery and. I’m here to collect my money! What do you take me for, brat! Don’t you know who I am? Don’t you yell at me! Hey, old man! Suppose.. Even if you were the President of this country. You still gotta take a number slip and wait for your turn! Wait to be called for service..

66
00:26:10.037 --> 00:26:14.842
Sweet mother of Jesus!! Mr. President!

67
00:26:16.443 --> 00:26:23.750
Mr. President has won the lottery! Manager, bring out his money! Yes, sir! Security, escort him, now!

68
00:26:23.817 --> 00:26:28.355
Everyone, Mr. President has won the lottery!

69
00:26:39.266 --> 00:26:41.201
I can’t go there myself.

70
00:26:43.904 --> 00:26:46.807
Everybody knows who she is.

71
00:27:09.096 --> 00:27:11.565
the moment he collects the money.

72
00:27:35.689 --> 00:27:46.166
It’s not a crime for a President to win the lottery! You’re a citizen the same as anyone else. I am, right? You said you’d donate it all to a good cause. You gave your word.

73
00:27:47.034 --> 00:27:50.838
It’s always the mouth! You can always take it back.

74
00:27:51.471 --> 00:28:05.719
It’s natural for a politician to change his mind. You have a point. Everything you stood for and the integrity of your government will go down the drain. Give up the money. But, it’s 24 billion Won.

75
00:28:07.955 --> 00:28:23.036
20-what? Why didn’t you tell me earlier? What’s there to think about? Just eat dirt and take the money! 24 billion? Man.. I had no idea!

76
00:28:38.352 --> 00:28:47.227
I’ll sleep on the plane tomorrow. You have to go back so soon? I’ll be back for good, next year.

77
00:28:48.795 --> 00:28:52.466
Is there anything you need? Are you short of money?

78
00:28:54.134 --> 00:29:02.109
The collapse must have hurt you somehow. Is it funny that I talk about money?

79
00:29:06.046 --> 00:29:13.453
Can I take this? It’s my favorite picture. It was the hard times.

80
00:29:14.388 --> 00:29:32.940
I was constantly on the run or imprisoned for political reasons. I was never able to pay your tuition. You were always an easy target. Ji-wook’s father never got caught even if he was with you all the time.

81
00:29:33.774 --> 00:29:37.211
That’s because he backed out at all the critical moments.

82
00:29:41.114 --> 00:29:55.794
On the day I arrived. I saw Ji-wook at the hospital. He hasn’t changed a bit. He is just as stubborn as his old man. Do you want to see him? Pardon?

83
00:29:56.463 --> 00:30:00.100
No, why would I? I’ll get some sleep.

84
00:30:11.378 --> 00:30:14.848
You boys are dead ‘cuz this round is mine!

85
00:30:23.056 --> 00:30:31.265
Chef Jang, do we have some soju? I’m not sure if it’s okay to drink, sir. You only just got out of the hospital.

86
00:30:32.032 --> 00:30:36.637
Have a drink. No, sir.. Thank you.

87
00:30:43.443 --> 00:30:57.057
No one.. We were just playing to kill time but I was about to win big when you came in. It was a double round.

88
00:30:57.524 --> 00:30:59.059
I don’t know the rules.

89
00:30:59.893 --> 00:31:02.062
Of course!

90
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:12.539
Looking back at life, I’ve never had fun. Why would you think that?

91
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:37.331
Suppose, one day, a ton of money fell out of sky. Pardon? Say, while you’re going your way about 20 billion Won fell on you from out of nowhere and no one knows about it because it was a quiet alley. What would you do?

92
00:31:41.068 --> 00:31:57.050
If that much money fell on me I would die. What? If that sort of money fell on me from the sky it would break my neck the moment it hit. It would kill most people on the spot.

93
00:31:57.084 --> 00:32:06.660
Even if you survived.. there’s no one around to help you. So, you’d probably die after a few painful minutes.

94
00:32:11.932 --> 00:32:24.711
You’re right. That’s what would happen. If money fell on you from the sky. You’d die without getting any help. Because there is no one around. That’s the right answer. “You die”.

95
00:32:31.318 --> 00:32:40.394
it is our duty and privilege to keep with the proud and noble beliefs of the patriotic martyrs.

96
00:32:42.095 --> 00:33:28.509
I sincerely ask you to understand and approve the decision that I and this government have made regarding the Independences Day special pardons of the two former Presidents. We must end the vicious circle of conflict rooted in political and geographical differences. We must unite in peace and work together for a better tomorrow. I believe today’s decision will mark the beginning of a triumphant new chapter.

97
00:33:34.147 --> 00:33:43.323
That was the end of the speech I prepared for today. But, I have another short announcement to make.

98
00:33:45.025 --> 00:34:12.252
Not long ago, there was a launch of a new sports lottery. Everyone at the event including myself, took part by entering. This isn’t part of a report on operations. But, I’ll make an honest confession before you all today. I won the jackpot.

99
00:34:21.962 --> 00:34:33.207
The winning numbers. 6, 8, 0, 2, 1, 9. It’s the date I proposed to my wife.

100
00:34:44.685 --> 00:35:15.549
24.4 billion. It’s the kind of money that I would never even dream about. I’ve decided to donate the prize money to a scholarship foundation to help less fortunate youngsters with their studies. I’ve never lived as a rich man. So, I lack ideas as to how to spend this money wisely.

101
00:35:16.116 --> 00:35:30.264
If my decision, which I believe to be the only right one, can help young people build their dreams, It’ll be my greatest joy. And, if I may add..

102
00:35:31.064 --> 00:35:45.145
If there is anyone among my predecessors who has money that doesn’t rightly belong to them. How about spending it on a good cause? Just my thought.

103
00:36:12.206 --> 00:36:17.744
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier. Have you lost your mind?

104
00:36:18.445 --> 00:36:44.538
Huh? I mean that money.. Good Gracious! Couldn’t you have kept a half, at least? I’m at a loss for words! -Honey, I.. -Forget it! And, you proposed to me in March, not February. Was it? I’m sure it was February. Have you ever seen cherry blossoms in February?

105
00:36:48.742 --> 00:36:55.249
You’re right. It was during the blossom season. So, it was March.

106
00:36:58.919 --> 00:37:11.331
say that I want to keep the money? And, be a national laughing stock? I could say. I’ll keep the money and give up the pension. Can you not talk for a moment, Mr. President?

107
00:37:30.851 --> 00:37:52.940
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the Republic of Korea and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Republic of Korea. President of Republic of Korea, Cha Ji-wook.

108
00:38:15.562 --> 00:38:26.573
The initial detection was made at 21:00 by the Combined Forces Command and we received the report at 23:05. How come we are the last to know about tensions taking place in our waters.

109
00:38:28.542 --> 00:38:37.918
Maritime command is still in the hands of Pacific Command, sir. Mr. President, it’s the White House.

110
00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:50.430
Very slim, sir. Not even a little?

111
00:38:59.873 --> 00:39:12.319
Good morning Mr. President. I’m sorry but it’s nighttime, here. Shit! I forgot. I just received the report.

112
00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.556
Of course, hours later than you.

113
00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:40.881
We will be having an NSA meeting in a few hours and of course our conclusion will be reacting strongly against it. If congress approves, we will be moving our 7th fleet. Shouldn’t we think about the cause first? Pardon?

114
00:39:41.748 --> 00:39:53.360
Japan has moved their missile base to the Northwest to protect the trajectory. And in the name of training, they have focused their Maritime Force on North Korea and in our territorial waters.

115
00:39:54.127 --> 00:40:15.782
As you know, without prior consent from the concerning countries a military activity of this kind can be deemed an act of provocation. Japan would’ve anticipated this reaction. Don’t you think it’s weird that Japan is knowingly creating tension?

116
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.920
We don't have time to think about such thing, Mr. President.

117
00:40:28.762 --> 00:40:44.044
but a military conflict. by all means, when congress approves, the Republic of Korea will have to open up both air space and its territorial waters.. According to the plan..

118
00:40:54.922 --> 00:41:05.966
enters our air and waters, then, so will the Japanese. Self-Defense Force, right? Be rational about this..

119
00:42:03.891 --> 00:42:25.112
We demanded the Japanese clear out by an official letter. In a worst case scenario, you should be prepared to get China involved. The simplest solution would be to convince North Korea. If they withdraw, we can untangle this problem. A more urgent issue at hand is the upcoming general election. You should really pay more attention.

120
00:42:26.213 --> 00:42:27.181
Approval ratings dropped again?

121
00:42:28.615 --> 00:42:29.416
Water, please?

122
00:42:30.617 --> 00:42:35.255
Diplomatic tension with Japan is creating unrest among the public.

123
00:42:36.156 --> 00:42:41.995
And, the party is grieving about the lack of support on your part. So..?

124
00:42:42.396 --> 00:42:47.935
Are you asking me to put on a show or something for ratings?

125
00:42:56.543 --> 00:43:02.580
Things are not looking good. We cannot afford to lose to the Opposition.

126
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:40.187
the Korean government.. isn’t actively dealing with the recent episode.. of provocation by the North Korean military.

127
00:43:44.491 --> 00:44:07.047
You seem to be mistaken. I have summoned you here, Ambassador! Not for your opinion or a chit-chat, were triggered by Japan’s military action. Do you understand?

128
00:44:07.114 --> 00:44:24.765
But, it’s a.. legitimate.. Please speak in Japanese. You have a translator. Wouldn’t it be easier? Why sweat it? -Just speak in Japanese. -Should I go home? I’m sorry.

129
00:44:33.006 --> 00:44:43.483
Take a seat. This training was a legitimate military activity. We never violated foreign territories and acted under approval from the Pacific Command.

130
00:44:47.354 --> 00:44:50.757
Do you take me for an idiot?!

131
00:44:58.999 --> 00:45:32.366
The Maritime Force intruded into our waters 3 times while relocating to the northwest and the standoff area is conventionally prohibited from military activities. You know that, don’t you? This is not military training but a military action and it’s a natural reaction for North Korea which works in favor of your government. Because such military tension will raise concerns for national security and stirred-up public sentiment will pave the way for legislation of the. New National Security Law that the right wing government always wanted. Isn’t that so?

132
00:45:33.667 --> 00:45:40.073
What’s the matter? Lost for words? I’m so sorry but you spoke too fast..

133
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.808
Don’t take the Korean government for a fool.

134
00:45:43.277 --> 00:45:47.848
We may have a humiliating history but we don’t do humiliating politics.

135
00:45:50.117 --> 00:45:52.486
We’d better wrap it up for today.

136
00:45:57.925 --> 00:46:04.231
Could you put the blind up? Thank you!

137
00:47:10.464 --> 00:47:28.248
The night view was spectacular with all the bright lights on bridges and buildings. I’m flattered. Thank you. Why would you be? It’s not like you built them.

138
00:47:32.252 --> 00:47:43.897
You cannot take an emotional approach with Japan. Because that’s what they want. They want to make an issue out of the current crisis.

139
00:47:50.170 --> 00:48:12.092
We’re telling them to stay out of our waters, telling them to stop pointing missiles at our country. In case they’re having wild ideas about our people again, we’re telling them we’re pissed off

140
00:48:12.159 --> 00:48:52.933
and that we won’t blankly stare like the Americans or the South Koreans. Are you saying you’re prepared to go war? Who are you? I’m the Chief of National Intelligence. But then, when you dropped a missile in Japanese waters or pressed on with plans to launch satellites, the surrounding countries passed over in silence. Because we wanted to prevent war, at all costs. And, you are..? I’m the Secretary of National Security. Did you invite me over to gang up on me? What do you mean gang up on you? Listen!

141
00:48:54.968 --> 00:49:13.554
It was the same back in ’94 and ’08 when the Americans pushed us over. We have never changed our position because we’re not Afghans playing with popguns in caves. Or some tiny banana republic in Africa or Central America that sprouts up and disappears.

142
00:49:19.026 --> 00:49:23.197
Are you scared of war, Mr. President?

143
00:49:38.278 --> 00:49:50.224
that I’m scared of. First is needles. Second is when my little son raises his hand with a question.

144
00:49:56.496 --> 00:49:57.764
candlelight vigils.

145
00:50:04.505 --> 00:50:05.739
We’ll go to war if it’s necessary.

146
00:50:13.714 --> 00:50:15.482
Now, you have to trust us.

147
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:26.560
No, trust me, Cha Ji-wook. I’ll prove to you that a solid government and good politicians are stronger than a million troops.

148
00:50:33.901 --> 00:50:52.819
Han Kyung-ja, the former Minister of Law. She’s a good card. She could be a breath of fresh air temporarily. But, are we ready for a female president? A publicity stunt for the election, clearly. You think so?

149
00:50:55.489 --> 00:50:57.357
Why am I going to the market?

150
00:50:58.358 --> 00:51:12.372
To get a sense of public sentiment. I would like to thank my fellow candidates. Hang on.. That woman there..

151
00:51:14.708 --> 00:51:19.580
It’s Professor Kim E-yeon, daughter of the former President Kim. She was scouted as the counsel for foreign policy.

152
00:51:20.047 --> 00:51:25.352
They seem to be a good match. Do you know her?

153
00:51:26.386 --> 00:51:29.323
What? Not really..

154
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:35.896
Our fathers were friends. She could have come on the scene earlier.

155
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:42.870
But, she kept a low profile until her father’s term ended. Smart.. really.

156
00:51:43.704 --> 00:51:45.405
She’s also the spokesperson.

157
00:51:50.277 --> 00:51:55.048
Well, anything sounds better when it comes out of a beauty. But, too hasty.

158
00:52:12.266 --> 00:52:17.604
some congratulatory flowers for Ms. Han? I already have, sir.

159
00:52:25.512 --> 00:52:29.816
Do you think I should send something for Professor Kim, too? What do you think?

160
00:52:32.619 --> 00:52:33.787
I have that arranged, too.

161
00:53:29.877 --> 00:53:41.688
It’s the easiest and surest way. You believe what you see. I should be making policy for people. Eating rice cake in the market won’t make any changes.

162
00:53:48.862 --> 00:53:55.636
That’s a good idea. Why didn’t I think of that? Rice cake..

163
00:53:57.104 --> 00:54:03.977
and, throw in some fish balls and sausages. It’ll make it all the more realistic if you actually eat something.

164
00:54:14.188 --> 00:54:20.527
This is really good! -Hello, big fella! -

165
00:55:42.176 --> 00:55:48.649
Mr. President! Mr. President! Please save my father!

166
00:55:49.383 --> 00:55:57.691
He needs your kidney! Please look at me, sir! Mr. President!!

167
00:56:07.768 --> 00:56:29.056
The events of this afternoon is an example of the misguided belief widely spread in our society that things can be achieved with a loud voice. Foreign press have reported today’s incident as an act of a mentally deranged man. The President was safe however and according to the police Investigation,

168
00:56:30.858 --> 00:56:54.948
According to eyewitness accounts, the President threw himself to the ground before his guards surrounded him. If what the attacker pulled out of his jacket was not a banner but a gun, we could have lost the most agile President in history. That crazy bastard! How can he be so quick?

169
00:56:57.351 --> 00:57:03.724
I’ll get axed for this, right? -Vice Chief! -Sir.

170
00:57:04.358 --> 00:57:05.459
Congratulations, man!

171
00:57:07.327 --> 00:57:08.495
Don’t say that, sir.

172
00:57:10.697 --> 00:57:26.580
Regarding today’s incident, wrap it up as swiftly as possible. A reprimand of some sort for security will be unavoidable. It’s become a bit of an issue. It’s late. Let’s get some rest. I’m tired.

173
00:57:41.261 --> 00:57:42.095
Excuse me?

174
00:57:43.297 --> 00:57:44.331
The transplant, sir.

175
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:47.234
Mr. Moon!

176
00:57:47.768 --> 00:57:49.536
Now the entire country knows it.

177
00:57:51.138 --> 00:58:01.515
A young man begged the President to save his father and only the President can save him. What would the public think?

178
00:58:07.321 --> 00:58:11.291
with an operation. Just the gesture.

179
00:58:12.259 --> 00:58:19.266
The President was willing to help but due to medical complications.. We’ll get the message across.

180
00:58:27.474 --> 00:58:28.976
It’s a perfect idea.

181
00:58:41.989 --> 00:58:49.963
If we pull this off, it could turn the situation around completely. What the public wants to see is the humane side of the President.

182
00:58:59.907 --> 00:59:00.941
Young-cheol!

183
00:59:09.049 --> 00:59:09.950
Come on, Ji-wook!

184
00:59:12.019 --> 00:59:13.387
I’m asking you as a friend.

185
00:59:14.788 --> 00:59:16.690
Politics is a show. That’s what we learned.

186
00:59:18.325 --> 00:59:21.628
Let’s put on a show, just once.

187
00:59:45.452 --> 00:59:51.124
Your name is Kim Joo-joong? Yes, sir. How old are you?

188
00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.362
Twenty.. Twenty two, sir.

189
01:00:01.001 --> 01:00:07.674
No, actually.. I’m on leave of absence.

190
01:00:12.145 --> 01:00:19.086
I’m not here to punish you. I just wanted to talk to you.

191
01:00:20.354 --> 01:00:26.193
There’s been some drama in my life recently. This was by far the best.

192
01:00:48.649 --> 01:00:58.759
It happens when I’m nervous. Sorry. That’s okay. It’s a physiological reaction.

193
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.162
when I was about your age.

194
01:01:37.464 --> 01:01:45.702
Mr. Cha Myung-soo MP, right? Not many young people know about him. I read his memoir..

195
01:01:46.573 --> 01:01:53.080
and saw a documentary on him, too. There was a lot of talk about you.

196
01:02:01.054 --> 01:02:05.859
about the mole on the bottom, and two vortices on your scalp.

197
01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:19.273
and that I have a rare tissue type. Yes, I learned all that from the book.

198
01:02:25.546 --> 01:02:55.409
Well, I came here to apologize. It’s not final but matching blood type and DNA tissue.. doesn’t mean I qualify as a donor. Also, being President of a country.. it’s not my personal decision.

199
01:02:56.210 --> 01:03:03.917
But, you achieved so many things by fighting opposition and proved that your belief was right. Sit down, young man.

200
01:03:12.526 --> 01:03:23.337
He doesn’t have much time. Please.. I beg you.

201
01:03:26.373 --> 01:03:30.010
I’m really sorry.

202
01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:44.658
Was there really no alternative to me?

203
01:04:12.386 --> 01:04:16.557
For a tissue compatibility test.

204
01:04:24.665 --> 01:04:28.468
The chance of a match is miniscule. The test will be it.

205
01:04:48.188 --> 01:05:05.172
At 1930, a plan of operation was served. By 0800 tomorrow, a regiment from the 7th fleet will pass the East Sea and reach the standoff point located at 220km off the Northeast Sea. Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force is included in the regiment? That’s right.

206
01:05:06.273 --> 01:05:27.461
This is the standoff point. It’s in international waters 120 km from our territorial waters. North Korea dispatched 1 Najin-class commodore, 3 Yugo-class frigates, and a maritime sniper brigade. Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force has mobilized the 3rd Maizuru convoy and have the 4th and 8th covoy on standby.

207
01:05:32.332 --> 01:05:36.703
Why is Korea so small on the map? Pardon me?

208
01:05:38.605 --> 01:05:43.410
I mean on that map.. Isn’t it actually bigger than that?

209
01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:07.768
If we don’t open up our waters, what happens next?

210
01:06:10.037 --> 01:06:34.561
The White House will call and play the wartime command card. I’ll tell them the current situation isn’t critical. And, then? Following more discussions.. You’ll buy some time. Three days left, right?

211
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:40.300
If we prove to the North Koreans that they can trust us,

212
01:06:40.934 --> 01:06:51.645
We must carefully weigh the gains and losses. The American President and the Republicans won’t be happy but we can prevent a war.

213
01:06:52.946 --> 01:07:02.789
Also, we can stop the legislation of Japan’s New Self-Defense Law and improve our relationship with the North. Much more to gain than to lose.

214
01:07:08.495 --> 01:07:14.234
No.. Everything is okay. What do you mean a war will break out?

215
01:07:14.735 --> 01:07:22.543
Test results are already in? Couldn’t they wait a few more days?

216
01:08:08.755 --> 01:08:12.693
if you give me a few minutes. That’s okay.

217
01:08:13.627 --> 01:08:17.798
I felt like instant noodles. This kimchi is amazing.

218
01:08:18.165 --> 01:08:19.867
You made it yourself?

219
01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:25.739
Usually, I do. But, we ordered ready-made this time.

220
01:08:33.981 --> 01:08:45.559
and asked me a question. He says he’s in love with someone but doesn’t know what to do.

221
01:08:47.027 --> 01:08:48.595
Kids these days are unbelievable.

222
01:08:49.530 --> 01:08:50.797
So, what did you tell him?

223
01:08:52.566 --> 01:09:09.283
So, I told him.. If you really love that person, love your daddy first, then, she’ll love you, too. That doesn’t make sense.

224
01:09:10.617 --> 01:09:15.756
It doesn’t, does it? -Use this. -Thank you.

225
01:09:25.799 --> 01:09:44.351
but I think I had a similar conversation with my father. If you really love someone.. No, that’s not what he said. If you really want to love, and save this country, Look after the hungry kid next door, first.

226
01:09:51.692 --> 01:09:53.727
How did I reply to that?

227
01:09:59.132 --> 01:10:02.603
but I don’t think it had what you said after, in the book.

228
01:10:11.144 --> 01:10:23.857
One time, an old man came to me, and asked me. If, while you were busy running around trying to make a better country, your neighbor’s child dies of starvation. Have you really saved the country?

229
01:10:25.192 --> 01:10:26.193
You’re right.

230
01:10:27.261 --> 01:10:43.944
I think that’s what he said. So, if you really love your mum and dad, you must love a friend who’s in a less fortunate situation. If you do, it’s same as loving your own mum and dad and loving this country.

231
01:10:55.923 --> 01:11:07.801
the crazy idea, at this crucial time? Look at the mess you made. The idea was to make a gesture. I honestly didn’t expect this result.

232
01:11:08.335 --> 01:11:14.141
Do you know how scared he is of needles? Mr. President is here.

233
01:11:34.361 --> 01:11:50.410
I believe this morning’s unscheduled statement gave rise to concerns and questions for fellow Koreans watching this program. Early this morning,

234
01:11:51.144 --> 01:11:55.816
this government made a decision to turn down the U.S.’s request for military cooperation.

235
01:11:57.784 --> 01:12:07.127
The decision is consistent with our principles of prioritizing national security and maintaining self-reliant peace in Asia.

236
01:12:08.996 --> 01:12:12.933
It is also a manifestation of our will to solidify trust with North Korea.

237
01:12:14.434 --> 01:12:40.594
Despite the grave importance of this matter, time was of the essence in reaching a decision which will be reviewed by the Assembly later. Today’s decision which entails the risk of diplomatic friction with the U.S. is a manifestation of our concern over the military expansion of Japan.

238
01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.441
on another decision I made.

239
01:12:57.144 --> 01:13:11.358
Two days ago, a young man came to me to save his father. He believed that only I could save the life of his father and that wasn’t far from the truth.

240
01:13:13.594 --> 01:13:28.976
I would like to announce to my fellow Koreans and my loyal staff, a decision I believe to be the best I could reach has been made. In a few hours, I will undergo an operation to transplant one of my kidneys

241
01:13:35.716 --> 01:13:40.754
the same rare tissue structure as me, who is teetering on the verge of life and death.

242
01:13:43.190 --> 01:14:11.552
During the six-hour operation and the following few days of recovery, the entire cabinet will do their best to ensure the smooth running of state affairs. It is my belief that if I can’t save the life of one man who needs my help, I cannot be the President for millions.

243
01:14:22.896 --> 01:14:31.471
Will I need general anesthesia, for the procedure? How is it done?

244
01:14:32.739 --> 01:14:35.509
Through oral administration?

245
01:14:41.982 --> 01:14:52.626
It’s usually administered by injection. I see.. well..

246
01:15:21.655 --> 01:15:24.725
Letting you be in a dangerous place without my escort.

247
01:15:36.737 --> 01:15:47.614
You’re sharing a life with me. Please live your half of our life to the fullest, for me.

248
01:16:28.956 --> 01:16:33.393
If you love your mum and dad,..

249
01:16:40.267 --> 01:16:45.539
What should I do? You mean, Jung-ho’s daughter E-yeon? Why do you like her?

250
01:16:47.875 --> 01:16:49.476
You want me to tell her for you?

251
01:16:49.543 --> 01:16:57.050
No! -E-yeon! -Stop it, dad! -Ji-wook is in love with you! -Don’t!

252
01:17:30.751 --> 01:17:40.394
The North Koreans withdrew their troops and, agreed to accept our terms of negotiation with Japan.

253
01:17:42.362 --> 01:17:46.967
No, I mean the transplant. Was it successful?

254
01:17:56.410 --> 01:18:20.534
We would like to express our support for the government’s diplomatic decision.. The government shall need to discuss the potential diplomatic friction and other related issues on a pan-national level. Also, we’d like to express our utmost respect for the President’s noble decision and, wish a fast recovery.

255
01:18:30.744 --> 01:18:43.857
I made some porridge with scallops. It’s not seasoned so, if it’s too bland.. Chef!

256
01:18:47.561 --> 01:19:03.177
You know when my father told me to look after a hungry kid next door. I remembered how I replied. Sir?

257
01:19:04.344 --> 01:19:09.449
I told him..there was no next door to us.

258
01:19:34.074 --> 01:19:39.680
It rose by almost 10% and, the party’s overall rating by 5%.

259
01:20:08.775 --> 01:20:19.820
you don’t really need to worry about this but.. there’s a man at the Hangang Bridge causing a fuss asking for a liver transplant from you

260
01:20:24.491 --> 01:20:28.028
which is totally absurd, of course!

261
01:20:30.998 --> 01:20:53.487
But then, if you gave away that, too. You could probably change the Constitution. Besides, you’re still young and fit. Mr. President! Come on, man! He can do it for one man but not for me? It’s the moment of truth.

262
01:20:53.554 --> 01:21:03.163
“The choice of the Nation”. At a 95% confidence level, and a sampling error of plus or minus 1% we give you the exit poll results.

263
01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:30.490
With 58.3% of the vote, Han Kyung-ja of United Democrats is likely to secure a victory. Han Kyung-ja of United Democrats won 14,350,000 votes out of the 25,100,000 cast, taking 57.1% of the total votes. Women’s interest groups

264
01:21:30.557 --> 01:21:39.066
welcomed the result with excitement and resolution for change. Presidential elect Han promised to rein in property speculation, and push for tax and educational reform

265
01:21:39.132 --> 01:22:04.920
from the beginning of her campaign. Two three.. and. One two three, One two three, one two three.. one two three.. Is this really necessary for your birthday? It’s useful to know how to dance. You’ll need it for foreign guests. Hey, what’s on the schedule today?

266
01:22:06.326 --> 01:22:12.933
You have a visit to an orphanage called Home of Love and a rally commemorating. “Housewives’ Day”.

267
01:22:18.539 --> 01:22:36.757
No, I mean my wife’s schedule. And, why do I have to attend a “Housewives’ Day” event? Well.. Can you not refer to me as “wife” in public? It’s been over a year now. Is it still so difficult? Well, you’re not my husband.

268
01:22:43.864 --> 01:22:46.834
Shall we wrap up for today? Yes, ma’am.

269
01:22:55.242 --> 01:23:32.079
It would be safe to assume that the eco-system issue is cleared for “Area A”. I’d rather be the scent of a flower than the flower itself. A scent called a housewife. A scent that makes a flower more beautiful

270
01:23:50.163 --> 01:24:22.529
Yeah, I can talk now.. Really? Was it tomorrow? Hang on.. let me check my schedule. I have something but I’ll definitely come by. Is “Jellyfish” and “Optimus Prime” coming, too? Great! I’ll be there. We’ve got to see each other when we still can. It’s not what you think.. It’s bad karma. Still 4 more years left

271
01:24:23.463 --> 01:24:26.800
unless she gets impeached or something.

272
01:24:33.807 --> 01:24:35.909
We are covered for everything?

273
01:24:37.911 --> 01:24:51.124
Well, the Assembly.. The Opposition’s resistance is stronger than anticipated. Tax hikes are always a sensitive issue. There is even a talk of red-baiting.

274
01:25:04.771 --> 01:25:24.992
a left wing government? Sorry, ma’am. This is the single most important policy of this government. If we fail to enact this bill, Korea will fall behind for another 10 years. We’ve got to be firm. We have two more days. Let’s give it our best shot. Yes, ma’am.

275
01:25:43.076 --> 01:25:54.588
Aren’t you coming to bed? It’s late. It’s a statement I’m issuing tomorrow. I’ve got to familiarize myself with it. What’s this?

276
01:25:54.655 --> 01:25:56.423
It’s nothing.

277
01:25:57.291 --> 01:25:58.725
Get some sleep.

278
01:25:59.326 --> 01:26:01.795
Okay..

279
01:26:11.071 --> 01:26:40.267
My old buddies are getting together tomorrow. Do you mind if I go? Please! We talked about this before. You’re not a private person any more. Can’t you refrain from attending personal schedules? I wouldn’t have asked if it wasn’t important. How do they know your number anyway? How would they? I called them to say hello.

280
01:26:41.502 --> 01:26:43.770
All right.. Good night!

281
01:26:54.181 --> 01:27:52.206
A hundred pigs and ten cows. I can still do it! Watch me do it! Let’s go to your place for more drinks! Tell your wife to prepare some food. How dare you ask the President to prepare your drinks? You’ll get lock up. No problem! I’ll call my wife. Let’s all go to my place for more drinks! Madam President! Tell my wife to come out. Don’t embarrass me in front of my buddies. Are these your guards? That’s Security One. That’s Two.. I don’t see Three.. Hey, Three! -Get Three to come out. - Yes, sir. Are you armed with guns and grenades? Shoot me! I’m Optimus Prime. My limbs are made of steel. Go ahead, shoot me! Stay away. Call the Residence.

282
01:27:55.309 --> 01:28:00.013
Tell her that Blue House is under attack from Optimus Prime. These are your guards, right? Shoot me if you dare!

283
01:28:01.615 --> 01:28:05.586
Near Jongro, ma’am. Why didn’t you escort him back before he got so drunk?

284
01:28:10.090 --> 01:28:11.525
Chang-myun!

285
01:28:11.592 --> 01:28:14.127
Look at me!

286
01:28:14.461 --> 01:28:18.265
He’s taking a leak! Let go of me, punk!

287
01:28:19.433 --> 01:28:40.521
I’ll never ever drink again. I prepared a French-style breakfast for Madam President and some traditional fish soup for you, Professor. It’ll help you ease the hangover.

288
01:28:45.959 --> 01:28:50.531
this morning. It was an unauthorized cell phone.

289
01:28:52.799 --> 01:29:08.815
I took the call.. It asked me if I needed an urgent loan. Should the President of Korea be receiving calls like that? They just call random numbers.

290
01:29:09.683 --> 01:29:14.021
“No interest for the first month,” right? I got similar calls a few times.

291
01:29:14.087 --> 01:29:15.489
What an annoying bunch!

292
01:29:16.190 --> 01:29:18.025
That’s not the point of this!

293
01:29:18.759 --> 01:29:23.830
You lied to me! Are you a spy?

294
01:29:23.897 --> 01:29:29.837
No one else carries private cell phones in the Blue House. I’m sorry.

295
01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:39.112
But, I have a personal life outside of my duty. I normally have it switched off and only use it in special cases.. I got rid of it.

296
01:29:40.347 --> 01:29:41.215
What?

297
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:55.262
I got rid of the phone. Good for you.. I still have 6 months on the contract but, never mind.

298
01:30:15.282 --> 01:30:22.523
- Hello! -Look, who’s here! How are you?

299
01:30:22.589 --> 01:30:27.728
Good. He’s grown so big. Have you been busy?

300
01:30:27.794 --> 01:30:29.530
Not so much.

301
01:30:31.198 --> 01:30:38.639
You drove here by yourself? I haven’t done it in years.. It was great.

302
01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:57.457
that government provided? I’m grateful for the pension.

303
01:30:58.292 --> 01:31:02.996
Why waste money on building a new house? You’re so stubborn.

304
01:31:03.063 --> 01:31:20.881
How’s the preparation for the policy institute going? I decided to put it on hold for now. It’s only been a year since the handover. It could be a little too soon. I’m thinking of continuing with my studies.

305
01:31:21.748 --> 01:31:23.116
It’s good to hear that.

306
01:31:23.851 --> 01:31:28.889
I was worried you might open a gym.

307
01:31:30.190 --> 01:31:33.760
How’s life as a single dad?

308
01:32:25.112 --> 01:32:32.219
Isn’t this..? Chef Jang has them sent over every now and then.

309
01:32:43.363 --> 01:33:02.015
In the name of providing good education, parents go through tough competitions.. What’s with her hair? Why do women in politics have that same bouffant hairdo? A bright red suit? Like a firefighter.

310
01:33:05.452 --> 01:33:19.299
Her skin looks great. Well, she gets the best facials. They have beauticians in the Residence? Yeah.. I got one every other day. How come I never got one?

311
01:33:20.133 --> 01:33:22.169
Maybe it was new from my term.

312
01:33:22.236 --> 01:33:46.026
Well, I got them. What?! That wretched Chief of Staff.. Can we watch some TV? You don’t care now that your terms are over? Shame on you. The Special Administrative City Law that this government wants to enact entails moving the capital into..

313
01:33:52.499 --> 01:33:54.368
He doesn’t talk rubbish.

314
01:34:05.779 --> 01:34:34.842
If this is true, she’s headed directly for impeachment. Have they lost their minds? You know I’m the best hit man in the Opposition. Let’s strike while the iron is hot. We can get this in tomorrow’s morning editions. Isn’t it her birthday, tomorrow? This will be the biggest surprise.

315
01:34:47.454 --> 01:34:49.189
Is Chef Jang here?

316
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:51.859
Over here, sir.

317
01:34:56.496 --> 01:34:58.131
Good morning, sir!

318
01:34:58.899 --> 01:35:00.701
-Are we all set? -Yes, sir.

319
01:35:01.201 --> 01:35:05.105
We'll look into it right away, ma'am.

320
01:35:15.782 --> 01:35:34.902
Here she comes! Everyone in their positions! As practiced.. And, one.. Happy birthday to you.. Happy birthday to you.. Happy birthday Madam President.. Have you lost your mind?!!

321
01:35:55.989 --> 01:36:29.923
for relocation of the capital, was it all but a part of her real estate speculation scheme? This is the true face of Han’s government. It’s beyond outrageous. How can we trust a government under corrupt leadership. Is it worth keeping this government? We must put it to the people. I really didn’t know! All I wanted was to raise pigs and cows there when we retire.

322
01:36:30.991 --> 01:36:35.896
What are they building there?! God damn it!

323
01:37:32.653 --> 01:37:34.021
At the Residence, sir.

324
01:37:40.627 --> 01:37:45.532
The Opposition will initiate a motion for impeachment at the Assembly..

325
01:37:58.745 --> 01:38:01.982
Mr. Choi went out for some air.

326
01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:14.661
You must act as normally as possible especially at times like this.

327
01:38:15.662 --> 01:38:20.267
If you don’t, they will bite down harder on us.

328
01:38:26.139 --> 01:39:15.522
It’s not all that exciting to celebrate a birthday, at my age. I would like to thank all of you who came to congratulate me and apologize for what you must ‘ve heard on the news this morning. It was a nasty surprise for me, too. As the President, I feel that I am solely responsible for what happened. Today, my husband was going to dance with me on stage but, he wasn’t feeling very well..

329
01:39:28.068 --> 01:39:29.803
it’s my husband, Choi Chang-myun.

330
01:39:44.885 --> 01:39:47.221
-Are you okay? -Yeah.

331
01:40:04.671 --> 01:40:12.006
I’m the presidential spouse, Choi Chang-myun. I’m sorry I’m late.

332
01:40:15.048 --> 01:40:20.988
Today is the birthday of my dear wife and our President.

333
01:40:23.891 --> 01:40:34.868
It should have been a day of happiness and celebration but because of me, it was one of the worst days in her life.

334
01:40:36.670 --> 01:40:51.051
I had a dream of retiring to a farm with my wife. So, I bought a small ranch with my life savings. I had no idea it would turn out to be such a disaster.

335
01:40:55.155 --> 01:40:59.760
I just sold off the land.

336
01:41:02.529 --> 01:41:34.661
Looking back, this wasn’t the first time. I failed to provide the support she needs for carrying out her duties as President. I regret so much only adding to her burdens. And, it makes me realize that I probably won’t change as a person.

337
01:41:35.596 --> 01:41:42.436
So, I made a small resolution and, felt I should announce it before I have a change of heart.

338
01:41:52.479 --> 01:42:05.592
I thought of you in the old days and I got choked up. You are as beautiful now as you have ever been.

339
01:42:31.285 --> 01:42:38.058
It’s not possible for me to be with you and live as a presidential spouse.

340
01:42:39.826 --> 01:42:42.329
What's going on? What did he say?

341
01:42:49.536 --> 01:42:50.671
I’m so sorry.

342
01:43:06.553 --> 01:43:12.025
It’s an emergency! A crisis! No, not a crisis either.

343
01:43:22.002 --> 01:43:48.695
For the first time in the history of Korea, a sitting President may get divorced during her presidential term. This afternoon’s statement by Professor Choi was his sole decision which he hopes, will allow the President to devote herself to her presidential duties. Lawyers for Democratic Society has volunteered to represent Professor Choi.. The public points finger of blame at the Opposition..

344
01:44:02.042 --> 01:44:10.517
It’s backfiring on us. Who did you hit, the President or her husband?

345
01:44:14.555 --> 01:44:43.684
This is an opportunity for us. A President with a family crisis! She’s as vulnerable as can be. Look at the survey results. Public reaction is contrary. They think we’re responsible for the President’s divorce. Don’t you know what she represents to the people? To the public, she’s the mother-, wife- and daughter-in-law figure. The Mother Mary, Korea’s Joan of Arc and Cleopatra..

346
01:44:46.753 --> 01:44:55.128
Maybe not the Cleopatra.. Is it not? Did I say Cleopatra? The point is..

347
01:44:56.296 --> 01:45:12.306
The opposition seems to be worried about taking the blame. Has she made up her mind about a divorce? “President sacrificing her marriage for the sake of her duties”.. Not bad.

348
01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:47.548
Professor Choi has been a ticking time-bomb. Maybe she’s better off without him. Have you ever been through a divorce? No, I’m happily married. I went through with it twice. When was the second time? The first time was not in the record. You think a divorce will allow you to focus better on your job? Who should be handling the matter anyway? The personnel affairs? How come? It goes under political affairs. What? Definitely not the foreign policy.

349
01:45:48.081 --> 01:45:53.253
Leave me out of this. How can you let this happen?

350
01:45:53.287 --> 01:45:57.057
You know what dad’s like! What about me?

351
01:45:58.058 --> 01:46:24.551
Are you blaming me for what he has done? But, you know how hard it has been for him. Before being one man’s wife, I’m the President of this country. How can I do my job if I have family troubles to worry about. If he can’t put up with it.. then, we have no choice. -Please mother.. -He started it all. Even if he comes back, things won’t change for the better.

352
01:46:25.352 --> 01:46:27.187
Suit yourself, Madam President.

353
01:46:32.593 --> 01:47:00.521
I loved him with all my heart. However, since taking office, I found loving someone as a private person a very difficult task. Today, I’m mustering up the courage to make an announcement about a decision I made.

354
01:47:03.690 --> 01:47:18.105
I decided to remain by myself as your President, not as a wife to a..

355
01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:51.905
What’s with the humiliating tone? Am I begging for sympathy for a poor divorcée? What’s with “tears” in brackets? You want me to cry here? Today, I stand before you as your President, not a wife to a man.. Like this?

356
01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:55.075
I’m sorry, ma’am.

357
01:47:55.642 --> 01:48:04.218
We’ve never dealt with this kind of situation.. Should the President present herself at the court for divorce?

358
01:48:04.751 --> 01:48:06.954
For formalities..

359
01:48:07.888 --> 01:48:24.505
And other things like alimony.. She is praised as the mother figure of the 21st century. And now, she’s fallen a victim of a political snare thanks to the Opposition.

360
01:48:24.938 --> 01:49:20.961
Although he claimed an innocent coincidence, he did buy land awaiting major development. Please, let’s use some common sense here. The President’s husband bought the land in his own name so that the world will know when he makes a huge profit out of it? A five-year-old would laugh at that. Well, he just did that laughable thing. Are you listening to what I’m saying? It’s not us that’s funny but the way you people think. Some claim that the President has made up her mind about the divorce. Nothing has been decided. Please be careful with the wording. Our society places great value on family, which is why the public is so concerned. They say “Cultivate body, order family then, make peace for the world”. People are concerned as to whether or not she’ll be able to carry out her duties without the support of a solid family behind her.

361
01:49:21.028 --> 01:49:30.604
It’s funny you should say that. The former President Cha was a wifeless father. Did he ever have solid family support behind him? A wifeless father?!

362
01:49:31.305 --> 01:49:41.715
Did you just refer to the former President as a “wifeless father?” Are you trying to insult the former head of state? What uneducated absurdity?

363
01:49:41.782 --> 01:50:15.349
How dare you talk to me like that? How old are you? Why are you asking me my age? We were in the same class in college. How old I am is how old you are! I failed my entrance exams twice. That’s fantastic! Well done for re-taking your exams! You must be really proud! Are you mocking me? You have just insulted the 200,000 students nationwide that are re-taking exams. What did I ever say about them? I’m talking about you! Take your words back this moment or I’ll see to it that you pay for it. I can’t and I won’t!! Make a public apology right this moment!

364
01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:27.294
No books or TV or talking on the phone while eating your dinner, okay?

365
01:50:47.714 --> 01:50:52.519
I hope I’m not interrupting you at a busy time.

366
01:50:52.553 --> 01:51:10.671
I have a favor to ask. Would you be willing to give a lecture for my students? I’ll check my schedule.

367
01:51:10.737 --> 01:51:28.689
This morning, the President invited her two predecessors, the former Presidents Kim and Cha, to a luncheon at the Blue House and discussed the main objectives and pending issues of her government.

368
01:52:00.554 --> 01:52:10.931
I studied politics at university like yourselves and served as the President until last year

369
01:52:13.233 --> 01:52:16.436
in case, some of you didn’t know.

370
01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:34.354
You parted with your wife quite early and served your term without the support of a First Lady. I think you might have hopes of meeting someone special again. Did you meet that special person during your tenure?

371
01:52:38.859 --> 01:52:43.263
That’s class A confidentiality.

372
01:52:48.168 --> 01:52:53.607
Tell us! Tell us!

373
01:53:01.315 --> 01:53:21.768
On many occasions, I felt lonely. Even if I had the best advisers and was surrounded by people who had faith in me. There were times I wanted to be in love again

374
01:53:23.537 --> 01:53:34.915
to have that special feeling for someone. But, I found that as a President, it’s difficult to love one person only.

375
01:53:40.554 --> 01:53:45.192
to love, cherish and respect one person.

376
01:53:48.962 --> 01:54:06.146
So, I gave it up. And now, I regret giving it up so much. I had lunch with President Han this afternoon. As you know,

377
01:54:07.247 --> 01:54:20.994
she is going through a tough time at the moment. I told her what I learned from my experience. To be President for one person when it comes to a certain moment.

378
01:54:27.935 --> 01:54:29.970
having regrets later on.

379
01:54:53.026 --> 01:54:54.795
Don’t flatter me.

380
01:54:56.797 --> 01:54:58.565
It’s getting chilly.

381
01:55:46.046 --> 01:55:48.482
It happens when I’m nervous.

382
01:56:45.539 --> 01:56:56.550
I haven’t cooked in years. Mr. Choi is a good cook. He made food here?

383
01:56:56.617 --> 01:57:11.765
Time to time, ma’am. On your birthday, it was Mr. Choi who made your birthday soup. So typical of him. How come you’re not married?

384
01:57:13.767 --> 01:57:31.952
My youngest is going to college this year. Excuse me! Why did I think you weren’t married.. Please forgive me. That’s okay. I get that from time to time.

385
01:57:40.227 --> 01:57:41.000
Pardon?

386
01:57:42.162 --> 01:57:44.131
How are things at home?

387
01:57:44.531 --> 01:57:51.805
I don’t go home much but still, it’s great.

388
01:57:56.276 --> 01:58:41.855
A President could make her people happy, even if she isn’t happy herself, couldn’t she? The President doesn’t necessarily have to be happy to make the lives of people better, right? I may be wrong but I believe.. just as a President wishes that all her people are happy, everyone wants their President to be happy. Not a single person would want the President to be miserable. You think so?

389
01:58:42.689 --> 01:59:02.409
That’s what people want. It would be nice if the President devoted herself to making the people happy but people who have a miserable President cannot be truly happy. Koreans are good people, A lot more so than you might think.

390
01:59:09.816 --> 01:59:18.392
I’m only a cook but I know that much.

391
01:59:27.968 --> 01:59:47.154
You know I had lunch with the two former Presidents. They both told me to pay a visit here, when faced with a dilemma that I cannot solve by myself. Now I can see what they meant. Thank you.

392
01:59:51.758 --> 01:59:56.697
Where can she be at this hour? She’s not at the Residence.

393
01:59:56.763 --> 01:59:57.898
Sir,

394
02:00:00.601 --> 02:00:04.738
I received a report that she just left the main gate. What are you talking about?

395
02:00:05.606 --> 02:00:06.907
Sir!

396
02:00:07.774 --> 02:00:09.009
The main gate!

397
02:00:09.176 --> 02:00:11.578
Right! The main gate!

398
02:00:11.678 --> 02:00:13.914
Don’t get in the way you idiots!

399
02:00:26.193 --> 02:00:33.467
Why did you let her pass by herself? Would she go grocery shopping at this hour, dumbass?

400
02:00:38.605 --> 02:00:39.606
Sorry, sir!

401
02:00:54.321 --> 02:01:16.476
disappear in the middle of the night? We were just chatting about happiness and other things.. While picking anchovy guts? What are you talking about? God, this is annoying! Turn on the GPS. Have a chopper locate the vehicle. It’s the Blue House.

402
02:01:17.110 --> 02:01:18.712
I’m the Chief of Security.

403
02:01:18.779 --> 02:01:20.747
We know where she is headed.

404
02:01:20.814 --> 02:01:38.565
Give them a call, too. Put me on! Chief Joo? This is the Chief of Personnel. Don’t have her pull over in the city. We can’t let anyone see her. Don’t let the press find out, no matter what! Escort her out of the city, okay?

405
02:02:15.202 --> 02:02:18.172
Where’s the next bottle neck point? An-sung Intersection, sir.

406
02:02:19.173 --> 02:02:23.477
Stop the vehicle before she enters the intersection. And, set up a road block in E7.

407
02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:41.855
I’m sorry but this is a personal matter. I assumed from the direction you were heading.

408
02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:47.060
It’s appropriate to use the official escort for this. Please let me take the wheel, ma’am.

409
02:03:47.995 --> 02:03:49.963
I don’t need an escort.

410
02:03:50.631 --> 02:03:59.106
I won’t be long. Your driver’s license has expired. Would you like me to call you a cab?

411
02:04:24.831 --> 02:04:28.302
Destination is Madam President’s in-laws’.

412
02:05:38.272 --> 02:05:40.607
You drove here. Why are you out of breath?

413
02:07:42.829 --> 02:07:44.364
Mind your own ticket.

414
02:07:44.765 --> 02:08:07.421
Let me see what you got. Don’t look at mine. Focus on yours. You have a lovely temper! “6” is a good number. Says who? I hope I win the jackpot this time. It’s not easy I know because I’ve done it before. You’ll give it all away again? I’ll keep it all for myself.

415
02:08:14.928 --> 02:08:48.529
People think that Presidents are special people. Of course, they are not wrong in thinking that. But, what we often forget is that at certain moments, they are someone’s husband, wife or parent. Their joy, sadness and happiness is not all that different from our own.

416
02:08:58.138 --> 02:09:13.820
If an old President comes over for a drinks, or a President who has given up smoking asks for a cigarette. In the early morning,

417
02:09:13.887 --> 02:09:25.758
when he greets you with hello we say to him with a big smile, “Good morning, President!”
