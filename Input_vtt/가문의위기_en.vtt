00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:36.837
MARRYING THE MAFIA 2:
ENEMY-IN-LAW MR.HOUSEWIFE

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.369
Mom!

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:55.916
Mom, Mom!

00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.987
48 minutes and 37 seconds.

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:04.691
You took frigging long.
I could’ve been dead by now!

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.627
God damn it!

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.496
What happened?

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:11.265
What do you think?

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.134
It was a test to see
how fast you’d get here.

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:19.106
This whole thing was a test?

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:20.140
Listen.

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:24.344
A constant effort is needed
to protect our family.

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:28.615
You should be ready
at all times. Got it?

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:32.219
You have no faith in me.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.822
It’s not that.
Your big brother did it, too.

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:39.860
Really?
How long did it take him?

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.064
Less than 30 minutes.
And he came alone.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:48.368
I can’t believe
you brought two minions.

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:52.539
There’s no comparison, Mom.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.708
I’m no match for him.

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.076
You’re right on that.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.084
- You know what? I miss him.
- You’re at it again.

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:06.787
Mom!

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.858
Mom!

00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:14.228
What the hell happened?

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:15.729
Save it!

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:19.366
What’s this?
What the hell were you doing?

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.601
Beats me.

00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:22.836
-You’re pathetic.
-It hurts.

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:26.206
Stop planting trees around.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.843
You’ll build a forest
before you know it.

00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:33.847
You’re beyond help, SOB!
Get a life!

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:41.488
Who was it?
Who kidnapped Mom?

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:46.260
It’s over, Bro.
Go finish planting a tree.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.534
I’m always left in the dark.

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:41.882
Give it to me, Babe
Give it to me, Babe

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.518
Put it on a vibrating mode.

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:48.522
Boss.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.158
It‘s time to go.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:13.247
This is my favorite song.

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:16.016
- I know no songs.
- What?

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:20.354
You must be too busy
with your business

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:25.492
I like hard-working men
like yourself.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:32.032
I go to work at 2 p.m.
and get off at 6.

00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:35.135
God, that’s a life.

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:38.705
I don’t like a hectic life.

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:40.974
I like taking it easy.

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:45.712
And I drink every night.

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.217
Drinking?
I absolutely love it.

00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:54.421
5 shots of boilermaker
get me, though.

00:05:54.655 --> 00:05:56.089
Like a blinking light.

00:06:02.763 --> 00:06:04.665
Hyo-jung, right?

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:09.236
- Do you have time?
- A lot.

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:13.173
What about pride?

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:16.009
None.

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.879
You’re senseless,
and I’m rude.

00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:21.448
Let’s not waste time.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.083
Excuse me.

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:33.694
Shit!

00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:40.133
What could’ve gone wrong?

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:42.102
I’m sorry.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.776
He’s so cool.

00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:04.825
What’s wrong with her?

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:09.596
What kind of chick
would you like?

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:14.368
Let me tell you.
You’re too picky with girls.

00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:18.272
You’ll never know.

00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:20.607
Okay?

00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:01.181
You okay, Boss?

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:03.917
You bastard!

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:33.747
Hi.

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:43.757
Hi, Miss Prosecutor.

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:47.694
Let go!

00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:52.332
Bingo!

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.704
A padded bra?

00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:03.744
What do you take yourself for?
An utility pole?

00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:06.246
Have a seat.

00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:27.568
It’s all there.

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.337
You can’t bribe me
with that.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.206
No way.

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:36.443
I’ll have a box full of cash
delivered to you.

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:41.315
You don’t get it, do you?
Money won’t do.

00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:45.586
Especially if it’s from
a thug like you.

00:09:45.953 --> 00:09:49.590
You came to return the money,
wearing a wire?

00:09:50.123 --> 00:09:51.525
To bust my ass?

00:09:51.525 --> 00:09:52.726
Let me tell you.

00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:57.164
I always check faces of those
that I’m arresting.

00:09:57.164 --> 00:10:02.469
Don’t be so uptight.
Have some juice and relax.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.739
We’ll talk then.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.525
Thought I’d drink it?

00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:28.462
I know your trick.

00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:30.831
You put drugs in it!

00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:32.666
You got me there.

00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:38.438
I thought you might like
getting high.

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:41.775
-You son of a...
-Gulp it down.

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:48.048
Once you get high,
my boys will gang-bang you.

00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:50.984
What?
A gangbang?

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.587
Why upset?

00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:58.759
After the gangbang,
we’ll sell you off to an island.

00:10:58.759 --> 00:10:59.526
Hey!

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:04.731
I’m KIM Jin-kyung,
a prosecutor of violent crimes!

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:07.968
A gangbang?

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.404
I’ll break your skull!

00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:12.840
Sell me off to an island?

00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:17.511
What the fuck do you take
a prosecutor for?!

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:20.080
I’ll kick your ass!

00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:25.719
You drank it.

00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:41.768
You’re... dead meat.

00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:47.407
Strip her and take pictures.

00:11:47.608 --> 00:11:48.708
My pleasure.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.948
Bitch!

00:11:58.352 --> 00:11:59.586
Hot!

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.604
Get her!

00:12:39.393 --> 00:12:42.796
God damn it!
See which floor she gets off!

00:12:56.944 --> 00:12:59.580
Mister, help me.

00:13:00.948 --> 00:13:03.417
Miss!
Are you okay?

00:13:04.518 --> 00:13:07.821
Wake up, Miss.
Miss?

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:16.763
Mind your own business
and hit the road.

00:13:17.197 --> 00:13:18.966
I can’t do that.

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:20.667
You’ll regret it.

00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:23.270
Beat it before I make you.

00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:25.606
Asshole!

00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:18.692
You son of a bitch!

00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:35.342
What’s going on here?

00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:38.278
When’d you become a cop?

00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:41.815
I bought it at the market.

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:45.452
Anyway,
who were those fucks?

00:15:13.814 --> 00:15:15.315
It stinks!

00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:25.259
Why strip her?

00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:28.762
Look at this.
I had no choice.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.708
Have fun, Boss.

00:15:56.023 --> 00:15:58.091
So strange.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.628
She’s a carbon copy
of Jin-sook.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:06.834
This tearoom is so nice.

00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:09.870
This is the coolest one
in Seoul.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:14.107
It’s called a café up here,
not a tearoom.

00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:15.876
A café?

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:18.078
What does it mean?
“To hit”?

00:16:19.213 --> 00:16:20.414
No.

00:16:20.848 --> 00:16:23.317
A place to drink coffee.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:29.489
Man, you’re such a genius.

00:16:29.756 --> 00:16:31.391
Ready to order?

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:44.238
Shit, it’s all in English.

00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:47.407
Coffee will do for me.
Make it cold.

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:49.309
You want an iced coffee?

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.547
- No, a cold coffee.
- Yes, an iced coffee.

00:16:53.547 --> 00:16:57.384
No, a cold coffee
with ice in it!

00:16:57.918 --> 00:17:00.587
- Make it ice-cold.
- Beat it!

00:17:01.955 --> 00:17:05.158
I can’t believe that bitch.

00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:10.063
Why can’t she just get us
what we order?

00:17:10.063 --> 00:17:12.399
They must be out
of cold coffee.

00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:21.508
What’s this?

00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:24.278
You do have a cold coffee.
Why’d you lie?

00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:27.548
She must’ve borrowed some
from next door.

00:17:29.283 --> 00:17:30.584
Wait.

00:17:31.752 --> 00:17:32.953
We didn’t order this.

00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:37.624
They give you an extra
here in Seoul.

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:42.296
-So it’s like a baby?
-That’s right.

00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:49.670
- Too sweet!
- You’re sweeter!

00:17:50.704 --> 00:17:52.973
She made it too sweet.

00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:55.375
Too bitter!

00:17:56.176 --> 00:17:58.111
That bitch ruined it.

00:17:58.412 --> 00:17:59.680
So bitter.

00:19:15.022 --> 00:19:17.391
You had a close call.

00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:21.828
It’s not broken, is it?

00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:26.700
Penis never gets broken,
but torn off.

00:19:27.034 --> 00:19:30.671
Some ignorant thugs say,
“My cock is broken.”

00:19:31.038 --> 00:19:33.841
But let me tell you.
That’s just plain wrong.

00:19:34.041 --> 00:19:35.442
Okay.

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:40.247
But it’s...

00:19:42.683 --> 00:19:44.184
Oh, these metal balls?

00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:49.356
I had to remove them
for the procedure.

00:19:49.623 --> 00:19:50.657
How many?

00:19:51.258 --> 00:19:55.495
2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
You put in so many.

00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:02.002
We don’t use these cheap,
low-quality balls.

00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:05.839
A lot of side effects,
and very bad for your body.

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:07.608
I see.

00:20:08.442 --> 00:20:14.348
At our hospital, we only use
top-quality metal balls.

00:20:14.715 --> 00:20:17.451
You want them inserted?

00:20:18.018 --> 00:20:22.122
No. I think I can do
without them.

00:20:22.422 --> 00:20:23.724
Suit yourself.

00:20:24.424 --> 00:20:26.560
Until your penis heals...

00:20:29.696 --> 00:20:33.233
You need to keep this on
for a few days.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.039
Should I put it on you?

00:21:00.561 --> 00:21:04.798
Once you get high,
my boys will gang-bang you.

00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:10.804
After the gangbang,
I’ll sell you off to an island.

00:22:04.591 --> 00:22:06.059
Weren’t you cold?

00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:08.695
Who are you?

00:22:09.263 --> 00:22:11.832
Why are you naked?
Do you know who I am?

00:22:11.832 --> 00:22:13.166
That’s...

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.501
Answer me now!

00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:18.405
You don’t remember?
Last night in the parking lot...

00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:22.676
The parking lot?
What did you do to me?

00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:28.815
Nothing. You were unconscious,
and I didn’t know where you live.

00:22:28.815 --> 00:22:33.587
So you brought me here?

00:22:34.555 --> 00:22:36.723
It’s not what you think.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:42.329
You touched me, didn’t you?
You’re dead!

00:22:43.063 --> 00:22:46.166
I never touched you!

00:22:48.635 --> 00:22:50.604
You did me with
that ugly thing!

00:22:57.878 --> 00:23:00.180
Nothing happened.
Trust me.

00:23:00.981 --> 00:23:03.550
Stay back, or I’ll kill you.

00:23:03.917 --> 00:23:07.087
Where are my clothes?
Bring them!

00:23:30.544 --> 00:23:31.812
Is she okay?

00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:37.184
Damn!

00:23:48.061 --> 00:23:51.932
You plant trees
in and out of the house.

00:23:52.232 --> 00:23:54.635
You should be awarded.

00:23:54.635 --> 00:24:00.174
Arbor Day isn’t the only day
to plant trees.

00:24:02.376 --> 00:24:04.845
I’m a bare mountain.

00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:11.985
You’re overdoing it again.
Okay, fine.

00:24:12.653 --> 00:24:14.855
I’ll turn you into a jungle.

00:24:17.324 --> 00:24:20.093
Good morning, Sir.

00:24:40.714 --> 00:24:42.282
Let’s see.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.655
Was it good, Boss?

00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:52.526
It’s not that.

00:24:53.861 --> 00:24:57.030
Don’t be shy with me.

00:24:58.732 --> 00:25:01.034
Nothing happened.

00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:03.537
No shit.

00:25:05.305 --> 00:25:07.407
How’s that possible?

00:25:07.741 --> 00:25:12.613
You remember my ex,
Jin-sook?

00:25:13.247 --> 00:25:16.984
One with a crazy perm?
Yeah, I remember her.

00:25:17.084 --> 00:25:19.253
Doesn’t she look like her?

00:25:20.053 --> 00:25:22.523
- Very much so, Boss.
- Right.

00:25:23.023 --> 00:25:29.429
So you banged her all night
until your cock got swollen?

00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:33.233
I said nothing happened.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.435
Pull your pants up.

00:25:35.569 --> 00:25:36.170
Okay.

00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:38.872
And...

00:25:40.507 --> 00:25:42.209
- Come here.
- Okay.

00:25:44.011 --> 00:25:46.847
Your damn fly is open.

00:25:47.381 --> 00:25:49.750
- Let me zip it.
- You can’t go in there!

00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:02.095
- How are you?
- Who are you?

00:26:02.095 --> 00:26:05.165
We’re social workers
from ‘Share Love.’

00:26:05.265 --> 00:26:06.867
So what?

00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:11.738
You can help the needy
and share love.

00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:15.609
So you’re saying
you wanna help the poor...

00:26:16.109 --> 00:26:17.678
By extorting money from us?

00:26:17.778 --> 00:26:22.983
That’s not it.
If you make a donation...

00:26:23.083 --> 00:26:25.586
That’s extortion!

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:31.024
You bastard!
Let me teach you who we are.

00:26:31.225 --> 00:26:32.326
Jong-myun.

00:26:32.826 --> 00:26:36.597
Once we help them,
they’ll come back for more.

00:26:36.597 --> 00:26:40.501
Life is pain.
They need to be independent.

00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:43.971
You don’t watch the news?

00:26:44.204 --> 00:26:48.242
That famous doctor has
succeeded in copying humans...

00:26:48.509 --> 00:26:49.943
...and Babel Prize...

00:26:51.311 --> 00:26:52.179
Son of a bitch!

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:53.814
- Hey.
- Yes, Boss?

00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:55.449
You’re not making sense.

00:26:55.449 --> 00:26:57.885
I’m sorry.
He got me too upset.

00:26:59.786 --> 00:27:00.587
Come here.

00:27:01.722 --> 00:27:02.523
Okay.

00:27:10.264 --> 00:27:11.331
1 grand?!

00:27:15.402 --> 00:27:19.706
Here’s my name card.
Call me anytime.

00:27:19.706 --> 00:27:23.610
I can drop by and tell you
all about our work.

00:27:25.212 --> 00:27:28.448
Your family name is JANG.
Family origin?

00:27:29.416 --> 00:27:31.051
It’s Ik-san.

00:27:31.318 --> 00:27:33.921
Really?
Me, too!

00:27:34.021 --> 00:27:38.192
Is that right?
What family are you from?

00:27:38.492 --> 00:27:41.528
- White Tiger Family.
- White tiger?

00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:44.865
Wanna join the family?

00:27:45.632 --> 00:27:47.167
Good with knives?

00:27:48.168 --> 00:27:50.404
Thank you.
Bye.

00:27:51.104 --> 00:27:52.539
Nice meeting you.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.413
We JANGs are all handsome.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.789
-Jin-kyung!
-BONG.

00:28:09.556 --> 00:28:12.426
What happened last night?
Are you okay?

00:28:12.759 --> 00:28:14.828
You got me worried sick.

00:28:16.096 --> 00:28:17.664
I’m fine, am I not?

00:28:18.398 --> 00:28:21.001
You’re gonna let them go?

00:28:21.301 --> 00:28:24.671
No way.
Pick them up right now.

00:28:24.838 --> 00:28:29.176
A little bird told me that
they traffic drugs.

00:28:29.643 --> 00:28:32.446
I’m waiting for a bigger bust.

00:28:36.617 --> 00:28:39.486
- I’m so sorry.
- No problem.

00:28:40.087 --> 00:28:44.024
Jin-kyung, it’s a CCTV tape
from that hotel.

00:28:44.324 --> 00:28:46.727
- Of the parking lot?
- Right.

00:29:10.817 --> 00:29:15.522
Bite your teeth hard, asshole.
You feel that?

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:21.261
Come on, keep your head up.

00:29:22.296 --> 00:29:23.931
Not too high, asshole.

00:29:24.932 --> 00:29:27.301
You feel that?
We’re not done yet!

00:29:27.668 --> 00:29:29.303
You’re pathetic.

00:29:29.703 --> 00:29:32.506
Why are you messing around
with a sandbag?

00:29:32.806 --> 00:29:34.341
What’d it do to you?

00:29:35.309 --> 00:29:38.645
I have to train constantly
to protect our family.

00:29:38.645 --> 00:29:41.682
Prevention is better
than cure.

00:29:43.884 --> 00:29:49.122
How about trying harder in bed
if you value the family?

00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:51.992
What are you saying?

00:29:52.392 --> 00:29:55.596
Producing children is also
helping the family.

00:29:55.929 --> 00:29:56.630
What?

00:29:56.864 --> 00:29:59.800
Stop nagging me, bitch,
before I make you.

00:30:02.035 --> 00:30:03.370
It hurts.

00:30:03.537 --> 00:30:06.807
Let go of my arm.
Right now!

00:30:07.107 --> 00:30:11.712
Let me jog your memory.

00:30:11.979 --> 00:30:16.450
I ruled the high school.
Don’t forget that.

00:30:16.683 --> 00:30:18.685
Don’t push the button.

00:30:20.521 --> 00:30:23.323
Mother’s looking for you.

00:30:24.391 --> 00:30:26.627
This is embarrassing.

00:30:27.961 --> 00:30:31.331
- You called them in Seoul?
- Yes.

00:30:31.865 --> 00:30:33.333
And?

00:30:33.901 --> 00:30:40.741
They tried to hook him up,
but he turned them all down.

00:30:41.408 --> 00:30:42.342
What?

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:48.382
Go to Seoul and find him a wife
by my birthday next month.

00:30:48.682 --> 00:30:49.550
Understood?

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.218
Okay, Mom.

00:30:51.318 --> 00:30:54.521
By my birthday!

00:30:57.991 --> 00:31:02.996
Hello? Young-mi?
It’s me, Suk-jae.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:07.267
I bought you a cell phone.
Remember?

00:31:07.568 --> 00:31:09.937
One with a thick accent.

00:31:11.004 --> 00:31:13.440
I’m coming to Seoul today.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.245
Anything you want?

00:31:19.146 --> 00:31:21.448
What dung?

00:31:22.783 --> 00:31:23.917
Louis VuiDung?

00:31:24.751 --> 00:31:27.588
You want me
to buy you dung?

00:31:27.855 --> 00:31:28.856
You’re hurting me!

00:31:29.857 --> 00:31:33.694
Oh, it’s a brand name?
No problem.

00:31:34.862 --> 00:31:37.464
I’ll call you
when I’m in town.

00:31:38.932 --> 00:31:40.834
Not too hard!

00:31:43.036 --> 00:31:47.241
Who on earth would name
their brand Dung?

00:31:47.908 --> 00:31:51.278
You never buy me
anything.

00:31:51.612 --> 00:31:54.014
You’re not pretty enough.

00:31:54.648 --> 00:32:00.821
You buy her Louis Vuitton.
Why not me?

00:32:01.421 --> 00:32:05.659
You’re a hooker,
and she’s not.

00:32:05.792 --> 00:32:09.463
Be grateful that I hire you
once a week!

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:13.600
Suk-jae, keep it up,
and I’ll tell your wife!

00:32:17.104 --> 00:32:22.042
You’re so hot-tempered.
Okay, fine.

00:32:22.042 --> 00:32:24.945
I’ll buy you dung, too.

00:32:25.445 --> 00:32:27.781
- Really?
- Of course.

00:32:31.218 --> 00:32:36.056
You hold onto boobs all day.
What are you, a calf?

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.458
We’re leaving now.

00:32:38.458 --> 00:32:41.128
Can I finish
what I’ve started?

00:32:41.295 --> 00:32:43.197
There are boobs in Seoul, too.

00:32:43.197 --> 00:32:45.032
Where’s the fire?

00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:48.135
That asshole is too pushy.

00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:55.142
We’ll finish this later.

00:32:57.845 --> 00:32:58.779
Okay.

00:33:04.117 --> 00:33:05.085
Who is it?

00:33:07.321 --> 00:33:09.623
Right after I fell asleep!

00:33:14.261 --> 00:33:15.229
Hi.

00:33:17.331 --> 00:33:18.098
Hi.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:25.072
- Can I come in?
- Sure, but...

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.671
Bravo!

00:34:02.176 --> 00:34:06.480
Sorry about this morning.
I didn’t know you’d saved me.

00:34:07.748 --> 00:34:12.586
Well... it’s nothing.

00:34:13.453 --> 00:34:15.022
Thanks for saving my life.

00:34:17.224 --> 00:34:20.227
No, don’t mention it.

00:34:22.796 --> 00:34:29.469
I don’t even know your name.

00:34:30.904 --> 00:34:31.972
You want to?

00:34:34.308 --> 00:34:34.975
Yes...

00:34:36.844 --> 00:34:38.378
My name is...

00:34:41.081 --> 00:34:42.616
My name is...

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.788
Bro.

00:34:49.122 --> 00:34:51.992
Was I in your dream, Bro?

00:34:55.562 --> 00:34:56.897
Were you dreaming?

00:34:57.231 --> 00:34:59.833
- Suk-jae.
- Yeah, it’s me.

00:35:00.601 --> 00:35:02.269
What are you doing here?

00:35:02.636 --> 00:35:04.838
Mom sent us.

00:35:05.439 --> 00:35:06.573
Why?

00:35:06.773 --> 00:35:10.944
We were told to find you a wife
by her birthday.

00:35:11.411 --> 00:35:14.515
Otherwise, she’s gonna marry you
to any girl she sees.

00:35:15.582 --> 00:35:17.885
She’s at it again.

00:35:18.418 --> 00:35:20.420
What can we do?

00:35:20.587 --> 00:35:25.392
We have to bring back you
and your wife-to-be.

00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:30.564
Don’t worry.
I’ll handle it.

00:35:31.298 --> 00:35:34.334
Since you’re here,
Why don’t we go drinking?

00:35:34.902 --> 00:35:36.303
I want to.

00:35:38.005 --> 00:35:40.774
But I gotta go buy dung
and plant a tree.

00:35:41.041 --> 00:35:42.276
I’ll take a rain check.

00:35:42.809 --> 00:35:45.445
We should let him rest.
Let’s go.

00:35:45.779 --> 00:35:48.081
- Go back to bed.
- Sleep tight.

00:36:04.064 --> 00:36:05.199
It’s not locked.

00:36:09.169 --> 00:36:10.404
It’s open.

00:36:16.376 --> 00:36:18.245
I don’t have any laundry to...

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:33.994
Hi.

00:36:35.696 --> 00:36:38.031
What brings you here?

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.337
- To return your clothes.
- Yes...

00:36:47.774 --> 00:36:50.811
Sorry about this morning.

00:36:50.811 --> 00:36:54.982
I wasn’t myself
and forgot to thank you.

00:36:57.484 --> 00:36:59.553
Okay then.

00:36:59.553 --> 00:37:00.220
Bye.

00:37:07.327 --> 00:37:10.898
- Can I have your name card?
- Sure.

00:37:35.689 --> 00:37:38.058
You’re a social worker?

00:37:38.625 --> 00:37:39.927
How nice.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:45.732
Can I have yours?

00:37:46.033 --> 00:37:48.769
I don’t have one.

00:37:49.536 --> 00:37:51.705
But I’ll call you tomorrow.

00:37:52.072 --> 00:37:55.142
Your name?

00:37:55.776 --> 00:37:59.346
Jin-kyung.
KIM Jin-kyung.

00:38:01.048 --> 00:38:02.182
Jong-myun?

00:38:03.116 --> 00:38:07.821
You have that guy’s card
from Share Love?

00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:10.657
Yeah, that one.

00:38:10.657 --> 00:38:13.927
Buy out his number
by morning.

00:38:20.033 --> 00:38:21.168
Are you eating, Boss?

00:38:27.508 --> 00:38:29.343
What do I look like I’m doing?

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:32.779
Sorry.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:37.784
- How did it go?
- It’s been taken care of.

00:38:38.118 --> 00:38:39.086
Good.

00:38:42.155 --> 00:38:43.423
What’s going on out there?

00:38:45.993 --> 00:38:49.730
Should I knock your teeth out?

00:38:50.898 --> 00:38:52.666
Keep you head up.

00:38:55.402 --> 00:38:56.570
Don’t I look familiar?

00:38:56.737 --> 00:38:59.439
Your guts are spilling all over.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.541
Stop hitting me.

00:39:01.108 --> 00:39:03.443
How could you extort money
from a gangster?

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.012
- I didn’t.
- Shut up!

00:39:05.412 --> 00:39:07.681
Where were you thinking?

00:39:07.848 --> 00:39:11.185
We were just trying to help
those in need.

00:39:11.318 --> 00:39:14.354
Where’s this society going?

00:39:14.354 --> 00:39:15.155
Asshole!

00:39:21.195 --> 00:39:21.862
Look.

00:39:32.673 --> 00:39:33.574
What’s going on?

00:39:33.774 --> 00:39:36.944
You told him to get him,
didn’t you?

00:39:39.046 --> 00:39:43.517
I know things are tough
these days.

00:39:43.517 --> 00:39:46.420
But extorting money
from a gangster?

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.322
That’s completely crazy.

00:39:48.555 --> 00:39:53.627
I told you to get his number.

00:39:53.927 --> 00:39:57.064
Not his organization, fool.

00:39:58.699 --> 00:40:01.768
- I’m sorry, Boss.
- You’re an idiot!

00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:09.877
What the fuck goes on
in your damn head?

00:40:12.312 --> 00:40:16.917
Suk-jae, What can I do with this head?

00:40:18.018 --> 00:40:22.022
You can use it
to balance yourself, asshole.

00:40:25.192 --> 00:40:31.131
That’s right.
Nobody can beat this deal.

00:40:31.732 --> 00:40:33.867
Hold on a second.

00:40:37.137 --> 00:40:39.673
Share Love.
May I help you?

00:40:39.673 --> 00:40:41.241
KIM Jin-kyung?

00:40:41.241 --> 00:40:45.979
I’ll fucking put you...
I’ll put you through.

00:40:46.747 --> 00:40:48.882
It’s KIM Jin-kyung, sir.

00:40:49.783 --> 00:40:57.224
Jin-kyung? Hi.
What? Dinner?

00:40:59.293 --> 00:41:00.460
You took care of it?

00:41:00.561 --> 00:41:03.864
Yes, we gave them money
for hospital.

00:41:04.097 --> 00:41:08.669
And we’ll meet later to discuss
our partnership.

00:41:08.836 --> 00:41:10.204
- Good.
- Sure.

00:41:10.971 --> 00:41:14.141
- What about name cards?
- Right here.

00:41:15.142 --> 00:41:18.512
Why social work suddenly?

00:41:18.779 --> 00:41:21.481
It’s not our cup of tea.

00:41:22.216 --> 00:41:27.221
If we’re gonna do it,
let’s change the name first.

00:41:27.754 --> 00:41:30.691
‘Share Love’ is so corny.
Isn’t it?

00:41:30.858 --> 00:41:35.195
Yeah, it sounds like
we are promoting orgies.

00:41:35.195 --> 00:41:35.863
Right.

00:41:36.797 --> 00:41:38.232
Any ideas?

00:41:38.498 --> 00:41:42.436
It’s a global age.
Why don’t we make it in English?

00:41:44.238 --> 00:41:45.472
Anything good in mind?

00:41:45.739 --> 00:41:47.374
Of course!

00:41:47.708 --> 00:41:51.712
We are introducing
a new business.

00:41:51.712 --> 00:41:52.880
So we’re like a MC.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.214
Right.

00:41:54.748 --> 00:41:57.618
A MC launching a business...

00:41:57.618 --> 00:42:00.420
What about ‘MC Business’?

00:42:03.056 --> 00:42:05.058
You must study English hard.

00:42:06.093 --> 00:42:07.494
You go to an academy?

00:42:09.463 --> 00:42:12.266
But it‘s too difficult.

00:42:12.432 --> 00:42:16.036
Yes, we‘re not good at English.

00:42:16.036 --> 00:42:17.204
Korean is better.

00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:21.275
It‘s your problem.
I study hard these days.

00:42:27.714 --> 00:42:30.551
Do you know what an
orange is called in English?

00:42:30.851 --> 00:42:32.085
Orange?

00:42:34.154 --> 00:42:37.057
I know it... Orange... Orange...

00:42:37.324 --> 00:42:39.259
It‘s... It‘s on the tip of my tongue.

00:42:39.526 --> 00:42:44.231
Orange, orange... Hey, Jon-myun!
You can tell me instead of me.

00:42:45.999 --> 00:42:47.334
Jong-myun, do you know it?

00:42:47.334 --> 00:42:49.303
How can I know it.

00:42:49.536 --> 00:42:52.806
- You don‘t know me yet?
- Why are you yelling at me? Bitch!

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.176
I forget again because he yelled.

00:42:57.811 --> 00:42:59.780
So tell me what is it?

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:04.384
You all idiots.
It‘s Delmont!

00:43:04.451 --> 00:43:08.388
Right, Delmont!
I only remembered Del.

00:43:12.025 --> 00:43:14.161
Maybe there‘s an eraser in my head.

00:43:14.161 --> 00:43:15.462
So get it out, fool.

00:43:15.462 --> 00:43:17.965
What a pity.
I almost remembered.

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.135
- Seok-jae.
- Yes, bro.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:25.072
What is Sunkist in English?

00:43:41.822 --> 00:43:45.125
Why you didn‘t tell you saved me?

00:43:45.125 --> 00:43:48.295
I‘m OK if you are safe.

00:43:51.899 --> 00:43:55.602
Dae-su, I have a question
about your business.

00:43:55.836 --> 00:43:57.104
‘Sharing Love’.

00:43:58.172 --> 00:44:00.207
Can you tell me about it?

00:44:00.774 --> 00:44:02.743
Well...

00:44:06.146 --> 00:44:11.018
we establish a healthy contribution culture

00:44:12.052 --> 00:44:17.191
and help needy neighbor...and...

00:44:17.658 --> 00:44:19.893
It‘s a great job.

00:44:22.462 --> 00:44:26.934
But I don‘t know what you do yet.

00:44:27.534 --> 00:44:33.473
Me? I‘m an... official.

00:44:34.908 --> 00:44:37.010
Ah, you serve your country.

00:44:37.945 --> 00:44:41.014
So what were you doing at the hotel?

00:44:42.282 --> 00:44:44.952
Well, I had something to return...

00:44:46.286 --> 00:44:49.156
If you have problem again, call me.

00:44:52.759 --> 00:44:56.363
I‘ll give you a new name card.

00:45:00.767 --> 00:45:04.905
Jang In-jae? The name is changed.

00:45:04.905 --> 00:45:08.442
It was Dae-su in old one.

00:45:12.913 --> 00:45:18.318
Dae-su Jang In-jae.
It‘s my alias.

00:45:19.953 --> 00:45:24.458
Wow, you have an alias?

00:45:30.631 --> 00:45:32.432
I‘ll do it for you.

00:45:39.606 --> 00:45:43.610
Where did you go?
I‘m waiting for you.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:44.611
Why?

00:45:45.712 --> 00:45:46.513
What‘s that?

00:45:47.948 --> 00:45:51.084
I prepared this for your wedding.

00:45:51.985 --> 00:45:55.322
Watch carefully and pick one.

00:45:55.422 --> 00:45:57.291
I‘m OK, you pick one.

00:45:57.357 --> 00:46:00.027
I don‘t need it.
I‘m already married.

00:46:01.461 --> 00:46:05.632
I‘m seeing someone.
So don‘t do that again.

00:46:05.632 --> 00:46:07.768
You have girlfriend?

00:46:07.935 --> 00:46:09.336
I had dinner with her.

00:46:10.103 --> 00:46:16.310
Wow, my brother finally
get a tree to plant?

00:46:18.745 --> 00:46:20.581
Is she beautiful?

00:46:21.281 --> 00:46:25.552
She‘s beautiful, and a public official.

00:46:25.886 --> 00:46:28.255
Public official? That‘s nice.

00:46:28.388 --> 00:46:32.659
Mom always wanted
a smart daughter in law.

00:46:32.926 --> 00:46:35.295
Well, your wife is an ignorant person.

00:46:36.496 --> 00:46:40.534
Son of bitch! I know that.

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:45.005
Someone‘s here.
Open the door.

00:46:45.906 --> 00:46:49.176
What did you say?
It‘s a letter massage.

00:46:50.143 --> 00:46:51.245
Who?

00:46:51.612 --> 00:46:52.980
That...

00:46:53.947 --> 00:46:56.016
Hey, let letter massage come in.

00:46:59.753 --> 00:47:01.021
Where are you going?

00:47:01.522 --> 00:47:05.092
You two are fool brothers.

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:17.137
What is it?

00:47:17.571 --> 00:47:22.543
It‘s smuggled goods from China
‘Breast cream’.

00:47:22.743 --> 00:47:24.845
Breast cream? What‘s that?

00:47:24.912 --> 00:47:29.183
You haven‘t heard of it?
It makes woman‘s boobs get bigger.

00:47:29.249 --> 00:47:30.884
Wow, that‘s amazing.

00:47:32.085 --> 00:47:33.854
Hey, you want one?

00:47:34.154 --> 00:47:36.990
What?
You‘ve got to be kidding.

00:47:37.057 --> 00:47:38.292
Or two?

00:47:39.593 --> 00:47:41.628
Hyo-suck, you want some?

00:47:42.563 --> 00:47:44.598
I don‘t need it.

00:48:00.747 --> 00:48:01.448
What are you doing?

00:48:04.885 --> 00:48:07.654
Ah, I‘m working.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:11.091
What?

00:48:13.427 --> 00:48:17.531
You look like you‘re trying to
cover something up.

00:48:18.632 --> 00:48:22.236
I have nothing to hide.

00:48:22.369 --> 00:48:25.839
That‘s not true.
You can‘t avoid my intuition.

00:48:26.773 --> 00:48:27.741
What‘s this? What?

00:48:28.041 --> 00:48:28.876
What are you doing?

00:48:29.176 --> 00:48:30.043
Let me see.

00:48:30.043 --> 00:48:31.078
I got it!

00:48:31.545 --> 00:48:33.981
I‘m very good at collecting evidence.

00:48:34.848 --> 00:48:37.217
Jang In-jae, Sharing Love.

00:48:37.784 --> 00:48:40.687
You didn‘t have dinner with me
because of him?

00:48:41.955 --> 00:48:43.590
Stop it, it‘s not funny.

00:48:44.491 --> 00:48:46.593
You‘re evading a statement now.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.896
You‘re asking a leading question.

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:52.566
Well, are you free tonight?

00:48:52.666 --> 00:48:55.235
I‘m sorry, today is tough.

00:48:55.235 --> 00:49:00.374
Are you going to meet that guy?
It seems like a personal relationship.

00:49:00.607 --> 00:49:04.278
Let‘s drop it, OK?
Get out, please.

00:49:04.344 --> 00:49:08.415
You have the right to refuse
to answer questions.

00:49:09.183 --> 00:49:11.218
OK, let‘s stop here.

00:49:21.528 --> 00:49:23.630
She‘s strange.

00:49:26.099 --> 00:49:30.337
Hello.
Yes, Jin-kyung.

00:49:35.042 --> 00:49:38.879
OK, sure.
See you later.

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:44.184
Look at you.
You‘re smiling from ear to ear.

00:49:45.319 --> 00:49:47.321
He‘s totally falling in love.

00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:48.956
Yes.

00:49:49.489 --> 00:49:51.091
You already sleep with her?

00:49:51.758 --> 00:49:54.795
Who knows?
Their love will be matured.

00:49:55.195 --> 00:49:58.098
Tell us honestly, bro.

00:49:59.399 --> 00:50:01.335
Did you sleep with her?

00:50:05.205 --> 00:50:07.107
I can‘t even hold her hand yet.

00:50:07.574 --> 00:50:11.144
What? Even hand? What the hell...?

00:50:11.478 --> 00:50:15.549
Why didn‘t you do anything?

00:50:19.586 --> 00:50:22.689
When you meet a girl.
Your rhythm is the most important thing.

00:50:22.689 --> 00:50:24.591
Only my rhythm.

00:50:32.065 --> 00:50:36.637
I feel heavy.
I did it only in my mind.

00:50:37.871 --> 00:50:40.440
Boss, I have...

00:50:44.378 --> 00:50:46.346
I have good idea.

00:51:02.896 --> 00:51:07.801
The theater is the best
place to kiss a girl, Boss.

00:51:08.602 --> 00:51:10.571
If you choose a horror movie,

00:51:10.971 --> 00:51:13.607
all you have to do is just sit down.

00:51:17.845 --> 00:51:20.581
Shit!

00:51:28.755 --> 00:51:34.862
- Don‘t say anything from now on.
- Yes, boss.

00:51:37.731 --> 00:51:40.133
I brought burning shame
on myself.

00:51:41.702 --> 00:51:44.171
So why did you believe me, boss.

00:52:52.272 --> 00:52:53.340
What‘s wrong?

00:52:55.242 --> 00:52:58.679
What‘s this?
It‘s inferior crap!

00:53:04.351 --> 00:53:06.153
Damn it... In-jae?

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.656
What, now?

00:53:10.791 --> 00:53:13.060
I‘m about to go out.

00:53:13.493 --> 00:53:15.462
OK, I‘m right there.

00:53:24.071 --> 00:53:28.375
If you wanna feel her boobs,
a motorcycle is the best.

00:53:29.776 --> 00:53:34.915
Because she cannot help
holding you tight.

00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:37.744
- Jin-kyung, Hold tight!
- W...wait!

00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:10.611
Seok-jae, thank you.

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:16.717
It‘s working, isn‘t it?

00:55:19.152 --> 00:55:23.290
That‘s why I said
I‘m expert about erotic love.

00:55:27.027 --> 00:55:28.996
Give me another chance.

00:55:31.598 --> 00:55:33.330
How about going to a theme park?

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.102
Riding the rollercoaster...

00:55:35.102 --> 00:55:37.538
- Jong-myun.
- Isn‘t it good?

00:55:37.538 --> 00:55:39.640
- Shut up.
- Yes, boss.

00:56:36.763 --> 00:56:37.831
Jong-myun?

00:56:55.148 --> 00:56:58.886
In-jae?
Maybe you‘re busy, now.

00:57:00.587 --> 00:57:02.389
Today was so great.

00:57:03.156 --> 00:57:09.997
Actually I have something to tell you.

00:57:12.232 --> 00:57:14.401
I can‘t hide it anymore.

00:57:21.041 --> 00:57:24.011
I‘m a prosecutor in charge
of crimes of violence.

00:57:29.249 --> 00:57:30.717
It doesn‘t match me.

00:57:36.089 --> 00:57:39.293
- Jong-myun.
- Yes, boss.

00:57:41.261 --> 00:57:43.664
- Give me a cigarette.
- What?

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.270
Please, kill me.

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:30.744
Keep that idiot in the house, please.

00:58:31.445 --> 00:58:33.213
He‘s useless to your life.

00:58:35.983 --> 00:58:39.516
This son of a bitch made my brother
take up smoking.

00:58:39.887 --> 00:58:42.456
Hey, give me an axe quickly.

00:58:45.559 --> 00:58:48.595
Mother Fucker, you wanted to beat us?

00:58:48.795 --> 00:58:51.698
Did you think we‘re a kind of drum?

00:58:51.865 --> 00:58:57.204
Anyway I want to investigate
your organization.

00:58:57.504 --> 00:58:58.872
Hold his leg!

00:59:00.107 --> 00:59:04.344
Stop it.
You don‘t need to do that.

00:59:04.645 --> 00:59:07.848
Bro, this sucker turned on our followers.

00:59:07.848 --> 00:59:13.453
You have to set a good example.
So let‘s fuck him up!

00:59:13.453 --> 00:59:18.192
He has no charge.
His boss made him to do that.

00:59:18.725 --> 00:59:22.796
- I feel so heavy!
- I‘m gonna go nuts!

00:59:23.096 --> 00:59:24.965
It‘s your lucky day.

00:59:28.869 --> 00:59:30.871
Go and buy a lottery ticket.

00:59:32.873 --> 00:59:37.077
- What‘s your name?
- Kwang-ki.

00:59:38.612 --> 00:59:46.854
- Kwang-ki? Is your family name Kwang?
- Jo Kwang-ki.

00:59:49.590 --> 01:00:00.367
I know, I know Jo Kwang-ki.
Go and tell your boss.

01:00:01.235 --> 01:00:04.738
If he leaves me alone,
I‘ll leave him alone, too.

01:00:07.407 --> 01:00:08.809
What did he say?

01:00:09.176 --> 01:00:14.114
If I leave him alone, he‘ll leave me alone, too?

01:00:14.448 --> 01:00:17.017
- Yes.
- You scumbag!

01:00:19.152 --> 01:00:23.724
Did I tell you to go and
be their messenger?

01:00:23.757 --> 01:00:24.491
No.

01:00:24.925 --> 01:00:28.996
Don‘t answer back, fucker.

01:00:29.363 --> 01:00:32.399
So now you stand on their side?

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:45.112
If you make a mistake one more time.

01:00:45.779 --> 01:00:49.049
I‘ll take off your hand, OK?

01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.648
I captured the movement of the Axe.

01:00:51.618 --> 01:00:55.189
Last night Yun Do-sick failed

01:00:55.189 --> 01:00:57.324
to get the Aquus night club.

01:00:57.991 --> 01:00:59.259
The Aquus night club?

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.729
Yes, there‘s white tiger
who coming up from Yeo-soo.

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:04.531
That night club belongs to them.

01:01:04.798 --> 01:01:07.301
Maybe they wanna enter into Seoul.

01:01:07.501 --> 01:01:11.805
White tiger? Can you make me
a genealogy of the White tigers?

01:01:11.805 --> 01:01:12.573
Sure.

01:01:12.873 --> 01:01:15.142
Why they didn‘t stay at Yeo-soo

01:01:15.142 --> 01:01:16.944
and they came up to Seoul for what?

01:01:17.177 --> 01:01:20.214
We‘ll arrest both Axe and
White tiger this time.

01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:25.319
Don‘t hesitate, you‘ve got to get information

01:01:25.319 --> 01:01:28.689
about them as quickly as you can.

01:01:29.189 --> 01:01:30.490
Our meetings over.

01:01:33.961 --> 01:01:34.995
How about cold soup?

01:01:35.495 --> 01:01:37.631
I used to skip over breakfast.

01:01:37.865 --> 01:01:39.967
Well, how about dinner?

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.971
I know a great restaurant where they
cook chickens fed with lacquer plants.

01:01:44.238 --> 01:01:46.406
I‘m allergic to lacquer.

01:01:46.707 --> 01:01:48.442
So how about spicy chicken?

01:01:48.542 --> 01:01:50.811
There‘s my favorite house in Jong-ro 3th.

01:01:50.878 --> 01:01:53.680
I have a reservation to eat Chicken soup.

01:02:07.327 --> 01:02:08.195
You were surprised.

01:02:11.131 --> 01:02:12.132
No, no.

01:02:12.933 --> 01:02:16.170
People look on female prosecutor
with a jaundiced eye.

01:02:20.374 --> 01:02:23.443
Why?

01:02:24.244 --> 01:02:29.616
They think we are spiteful.
Well, I‘m little tough actually.

01:02:31.351 --> 01:02:36.023
Of course they have to be tough.

01:02:36.924 --> 01:02:42.396
I have no secret now.
How about you?

01:03:47.561 --> 01:03:48.495
Mr. Bong?

01:04:28.769 --> 01:04:31.638
Markes de Riscal...

01:04:32.239 --> 01:04:35.209
it‘s a perfect wine for
romantic guy like me.

01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:36.810
What do you think?

01:04:37.444 --> 01:04:41.582
It‘s good.
Anyway, you have something to tell me?

01:04:42.416 --> 01:04:44.117
Ah, that is...

01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:46.720
Why do you hesitate?

01:04:55.028 --> 01:04:56.663
Here‘s your dessert, sir.

01:05:10.677 --> 01:05:14.681
- Jin-kyung, will you marry me?
- What?

01:05:15.282 --> 01:05:18.185
I‘ve been watching you for 3 years.

01:05:19.052 --> 01:05:20.954
I was thinking a lot.

01:05:21.522 --> 01:05:23.490
You deserve to get me.

01:05:24.591 --> 01:05:28.228
Well, wait a second.

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:30.831
Where is the rest room?

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.002
Follow me, please.

01:05:41.108 --> 01:05:42.109
What?

01:05:49.016 --> 01:05:53.187
Is he a fool? I never go out with him.

01:06:00.794 --> 01:06:06.667
In-jae? I have dinner with a colleague.

01:06:08.402 --> 01:06:10.938
In-jae, Are you drunk?

01:06:12.639 --> 01:06:15.475
What, you‘re going to come here?

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:25.652
I always miss you so much.

01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:31.925
But you‘re not as close
as you in my mind.

01:06:32.526 --> 01:06:37.431
Looking at worn out picture of you.

01:06:37.431 --> 01:06:41.001
Excuse me, did you see the guy?

01:06:41.902 --> 01:06:44.338
- Maybe he‘s gone because he‘s in shock.
- What?

01:06:45.706 --> 01:06:49.309
You refused his proposal.

01:06:51.645 --> 01:06:56.083
I always miss you.
Where did you go?

01:06:57.951 --> 01:07:08.262
I see you in my tear.
Come back to me, please.

01:07:08.862 --> 01:07:10.026
What the...

01:07:10.631 --> 01:07:16.370
Come back to me.
Please come back to me.

01:07:16.937 --> 01:07:21.275
I‘m always thinking of you.

01:07:23.277 --> 01:07:37.457
You can‘t avoid my ardent love.
Please come back to me.

01:08:04.384 --> 01:08:14.761
I always miss you.
Where did you go?

01:08:16.997 --> 01:08:27.074
I see you in my tear.
Come back to me, please.

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.976
You had one too many.

01:08:29.076 --> 01:08:33.547
No, I didn‘t drink too much.

01:08:36.016 --> 01:08:37.885
Can we talk?

01:08:38.952 --> 01:08:41.088
OK, let‘s get out of here.

01:08:42.256 --> 01:08:57.671
You can‘t avoid my ardent love.
Please come back to me.

01:09:05.145 --> 01:09:06.346
What‘s wrong with you?

01:09:07.147 --> 01:09:08.849
It‘s the first time I see you drunk.

01:09:10.384 --> 01:09:15.622
Actually, today is my birthday so...

01:09:16.223 --> 01:09:18.959
What? Why didn‘t you tell me?

01:09:20.394 --> 01:09:24.631
I usually drink alone.

01:09:27.467 --> 01:09:28.335
Wait here.

01:09:35.609 --> 01:09:38.545
Happy birthday.

01:09:44.651 --> 01:09:50.958
There‘s something you
have to know about me.

01:09:54.928 --> 01:09:58.332
- Actually, I‘m...
- I‘II get it as time goes by.

01:09:58.332 --> 01:10:00.234
No, it‘s too late...

01:10:00.234 --> 01:10:06.540
What you did and Who you met
it‘s not important for me.

01:10:06.707 --> 01:10:09.943
I really don‘t care.

01:10:10.811 --> 01:10:12.746
if you can stay with me from now.

01:10:17.084 --> 01:10:22.122
I‘m relieved at what you said.

01:10:23.857 --> 01:10:27.928
There was a dark age in my life.

01:10:28.862 --> 01:10:33.800
I understand.
But it makes you like you.

01:10:34.601 --> 01:10:38.038
It‘s impossible you were a gangster.

01:10:39.873 --> 01:10:41.775
So you are enough for me.

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:44.378
Happy birthday.

01:10:56.557 --> 01:11:00.093
- You‘re still working?
- Yes, what is it?

01:11:00.527 --> 01:11:01.662
White tiger‘s genealogy.

01:11:02.663 --> 01:11:05.532
Give me.
That‘s OK, give me.

01:11:12.105 --> 01:11:13.774
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

01:11:13.774 --> 01:11:14.775
Hello.

01:11:16.143 --> 01:11:18.111
Here you are.

01:11:18.879 --> 01:11:20.948
I was sorry yesterday.

01:11:21.515 --> 01:11:23.083
But I...

01:11:28.288 --> 01:11:29.656
White tiger

01:11:44.037 --> 01:11:48.775
What the hell is it?
You‘re kidding me?

01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:51.712
I don‘t have time to that.

01:11:51.745 --> 01:11:53.213
You can believe what you see.

01:11:53.447 --> 01:11:56.183
Jang In-jae is a fucking gangster.

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:59.219
That oily, hooknose fucking gangster.

01:11:59.853 --> 01:12:02.823
It‘s impossible.

01:12:03.524 --> 01:12:05.792
I cannot believe this picture.

01:12:05.926 --> 01:12:08.362
It‘s a different person
with the same name.

01:12:09.897 --> 01:12:15.502
It‘s ridiculous.
I know him very well.

01:12:17.237 --> 01:12:20.741
Jin-kyung, are you an idiot?

01:12:21.575 --> 01:12:24.044
That motherfucker is lying to you.

01:12:24.978 --> 01:12:28.215
No, he saved my life

01:12:28.282 --> 01:12:30.884
when I met Axe‘s boss, Do-sick.

01:12:31.451 --> 01:12:33.253
He saved me.

01:12:34.188 --> 01:12:36.256
Anyway never meet him again.

01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:40.894
He certainly has a plot in mind.

01:12:55.909 --> 01:12:57.778
Take care, boss.

01:12:58.812 --> 01:13:00.147
Take care.

01:13:01.648 --> 01:13:04.084
- Take care, boss.
- OK.

01:13:04.785 --> 01:13:07.721
Do not loaf on the job in the office!

01:13:31.879 --> 01:13:33.647
- Jin-kyung.
- In-jae.

01:13:35.349 --> 01:13:37.184
You didn‘t answer the phone all day.

01:13:39.887 --> 01:13:41.021
What‘s wrong?

01:13:41.655 --> 01:13:48.228
Nothing, just because I was so busy today.

01:13:48.328 --> 01:13:51.064
Why didn‘t you call me?
I worried.

01:13:51.298 --> 01:13:51.899
I‘m sorry.

01:13:52.833 --> 01:13:53.800
Did you eat dinner?

01:13:58.238 --> 01:14:01.241
You look so pale, are you OK?

01:14:03.043 --> 01:14:04.878
I‘m just so tired.

01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:07.281
You wanna eat something?

01:14:08.415 --> 01:14:11.251
No, it‘s better take a rest.

01:14:13.887 --> 01:14:18.725
I see, OK...

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.629
Something to tell me?

01:14:25.966 --> 01:14:33.140
Well... My mother‘s birthday is
the day after tomorrow.

01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:39.780
Really? Congratulations.
I have to go.

01:14:54.194 --> 01:14:57.798
You washed yourself too hard.

01:14:58.098 --> 01:14:59.299
Your tattoo must be erased.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.769
For mom‘s birthday party.

01:15:05.172 --> 01:15:07.241
- Seok-jae.
- Yes, bro.

01:15:08.342 --> 01:15:09.710
Do you like that?

01:15:14.915 --> 01:15:19.620
I mean family business, gangster.

01:15:20.754 --> 01:15:24.791
Hey, who wants to be a gangster?

01:15:25.225 --> 01:15:29.363
But it‘s our family business and my job.

01:15:29.863 --> 01:15:32.666
Why? You don‘t like it?

01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:40.536
No, I don‘t like it.
I don‘t wanna do this anymore.

01:15:40.774 --> 01:15:45.279
You cannot say that.
You‘re our leader.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.515
Why do you suddenly say that?

01:15:49.349 --> 01:15:51.785
It‘s your girlfriend?

01:15:53.253 --> 01:15:56.323
She doesn‘t like you
because you‘re a gangster?

01:15:57.758 --> 01:16:00.894
Do you remember father‘s word?

01:16:01.662 --> 01:16:04.364
Father said that a woman is
just an obstacle to a man.

01:16:05.265 --> 01:16:10.637
A good girl is someone who waits
for man... like furniture.

01:16:11.171 --> 01:16:13.607
It‘s so difficult

01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:17.477
to meet a good girl.

01:16:17.945 --> 01:16:20.480
But you‘re the boss who‘s leading us.

01:16:21.515 --> 01:16:23.450
So think carefully.

01:16:29.456 --> 01:16:30.224
Prosecutor.

01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:36.530
White tiger haven‘t any criminal
records in Seoul.

01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:39.533
It was contrary to our expectation.

01:16:40.834 --> 01:16:41.702
Good job.

01:16:42.369 --> 01:16:45.906
This is the information you asked.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:51.144
Contribution Data

01:17:20.908 --> 01:17:22.009
Come here, bitch.

01:17:22.743 --> 01:17:27.247
What the hell is this flower?
It‘s not a graduation ceremony.

01:17:29.349 --> 01:17:30.817
Woo, what is it?

01:17:31.351 --> 01:17:35.355
Ah, good job.
Write down your name.

01:17:35.722 --> 01:17:37.758
Welcome, come in.

01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:44.565
Why don‘t you bring your girlfriend?

01:17:44.598 --> 01:17:47.334
I said it‘s my desire.

01:17:48.635 --> 01:17:51.505
I‘m sorry.
I‘ll bring her in the near future.

01:17:52.172 --> 01:17:52.673
President No

01:17:52.673 --> 01:17:56.810
Flowers for my mom?
What‘s the occasion?

01:17:59.813 --> 01:18:04.785
Hyo-ri, Seven, Eric, Bee...

01:18:05.719 --> 01:18:07.821
It‘s a collection of all the stars.

01:18:07.855 --> 01:18:15.596
Spider, Turtle, Chicken...
You opened a zoo?

01:18:15.662 --> 01:18:18.432
What‘s all these animals?

01:18:18.532 --> 01:18:20.567
These are names of singers!

01:18:20.801 --> 01:18:27.174
Really? What kind of name is it?
It so weird.

01:18:28.775 --> 01:18:32.779
S-papa? Who‘s papa is it?

01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:38.352
I‘m Kim Duck-man.

01:18:49.663 --> 01:18:50.664
Let me see.

01:18:54.301 --> 01:18:58.639
It‘s not a birthday party for baby.

01:18:58.839 --> 01:19:03.143
You think my mom is a one year baby?

01:19:04.044 --> 01:19:05.679
Take it back, fucker.

01:19:06.647 --> 01:19:09.183
Wait, what‘s your name?

01:19:09.183 --> 01:19:13.353
I apologize.
I‘ll buy something else.

01:19:13.887 --> 01:19:16.223
Jong-myun, follow him

01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:18.792
and watch he‘s going back here.

01:19:18.926 --> 01:19:19.893
Yes.

01:19:20.294 --> 01:19:21.061
How many?

01:19:21.662 --> 01:19:25.265
Freeze or I‘ll kill you today...

01:19:45.719 --> 01:19:50.257
Jin-kyung, how could you...

01:19:50.490 --> 01:19:54.194
It‘s your mother‘s birthday.
Of course I have to come.

01:19:55.195 --> 01:19:59.366
- Who‘s this lady?
- Well, she is...

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:02.336
Hello, my name is Kim Jin-kyung.

01:20:02.903 --> 01:20:04.671
Happy birthday to you.

01:20:04.805 --> 01:20:08.809
What? So you tell a lie?

01:20:09.076 --> 01:20:11.378
You‘re so cute today!

01:20:12.279 --> 01:20:19.219
What a beautiful girl.
Thank you for coming.

01:20:19.319 --> 01:20:22.489
It took such a long time
to come here from Seoul.

01:20:23.156 --> 01:20:29.429
Hello, I‘m second brother
Jang Seok-jae.

01:20:29.496 --> 01:20:31.064
How are you?

01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:34.601
You got fur on the tongue?
What happened to your way of talking?

01:20:35.068 --> 01:20:37.905
What are you doing?
Come in with her.

01:20:37.971 --> 01:20:39.039
Yes, mom.

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:42.075
Let‘s go, hurry.

01:20:49.183 --> 01:20:54.288
Hey, who is that bitch?
Why does she take that bitch?

01:20:54.421 --> 01:20:58.854
Watch your mouth.
She‘s a fiancé of In-jae.

01:20:59.126 --> 01:21:01.295
It‘s so weird.

01:21:01.728 --> 01:21:05.299
She‘s very similar with Jin-sook.

01:21:05.666 --> 01:21:08.836
Jin-sook? You‘re right.

01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:12.773
He surely has his own style.

01:21:13.006 --> 01:21:16.577
He likes the girl who looks
like anchovy‘s head.

01:21:20.714 --> 01:21:24.952
We already broke up.

01:21:26.019 --> 01:21:30.324
So don‘t cry when you‘re sad.

01:21:31.325 --> 01:21:40.896
Do not have lingering affection.
It‘s too late.

01:21:41.835 --> 01:21:46.673
And hide your tear, save your tear.

01:21:47.274 --> 01:21:50.677
Loneliness is more painful than parting.

01:21:50.677 --> 01:21:54.381
Oh, you‘re so sexy.

01:21:57.551 --> 01:22:01.588
Just cry when you miss her.

01:22:03.056 --> 01:22:05.726
Happy birthday, Mrs. Hong.

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.263
My name is Nu Hun-a.

01:22:10.197 --> 01:22:11.431
Hi, Mrs. Hong.

01:22:11.532 --> 01:22:13.767
- Congratulation!
- Thank you.

01:22:13.767 --> 01:22:18.038
- You look very good, Mrs. Hong.
- Thank you.

01:22:18.672 --> 01:22:22.209
Look, she‘ll be
the eldest daughter-in-Iaw.

01:22:22.309 --> 01:22:26.213
- So pretty!
- Of course.

01:22:26.947 --> 01:22:32.219
This is Cheon, he owns almost
all the room salons in Sun-cheon.

01:22:32.286 --> 01:22:36.456
Stop it, please.
I am ashamed.

01:22:37.157 --> 01:22:39.960
This is Park, from Kwang-ju.

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:40.861
Nice to see you.

01:22:40.961 --> 01:22:45.866
Every pimp in Kwang-ju knows his name.

01:22:45.933 --> 01:22:50.871
He goes into prison so often
that you can see his face in TV.

01:22:51.205 --> 01:22:54.908
Be a good person, bitch.

01:22:55.576 --> 01:23:00.013
This is Yosimura Sato Sang, from Japan.

01:23:09.089 --> 01:23:11.291
What does she do?

01:23:11.358 --> 01:23:15.162
She‘s a public official.

01:23:15.495 --> 01:23:18.999
Do you know how hard it is
being a public official?

01:23:19.199 --> 01:23:20.100
- I know.
- Official?

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.802
She‘s working at...

01:23:25.439 --> 01:23:26.874
At the Public Prosecutor’s Office.

01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:30.611
She‘s familiar with prosecutors!

01:23:30.744 --> 01:23:32.045
Public Prosecutor’s Office?

01:23:33.814 --> 01:23:37.718
It‘s such a hard work place for a woman.

01:23:38.318 --> 01:23:39.786
So what‘s your duty?

01:23:40.053 --> 01:23:41.255
I‘m prosecutor of violent crimes.

01:23:41.855 --> 01:23:44.558
My God!

01:23:45.526 --> 01:23:48.228
So... you doing...

01:23:48.328 --> 01:23:52.366
I throw gangsters into prison.

01:23:58.839 --> 01:24:00.274
Fuck.

01:24:04.444 --> 01:24:06.280
- Mrs. Hong.
- Yes?

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.046
- I‘m sorry but I have to go now.
- OK, ok, you can go.

01:24:11.852 --> 01:24:14.555
Sorry but my mother is sick.

01:24:14.555 --> 01:24:17.457
What? She almost dead? Go.

01:24:18.091 --> 01:24:20.460
- Me too...
- Yes, just go, go.

01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:23.630
Everybody go now.

01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:27.301
Hurry up, go.

01:24:27.534 --> 01:24:31.705
I was born at bust day.

01:24:45.419 --> 01:24:50.891
So you are...
You‘re the honorable prosecutor Kim...

01:24:51.058 --> 01:24:53.227
Please drop the honorific title.

01:24:53.227 --> 01:24:55.696
No, how can I do that.

01:24:55.863 --> 01:24:58.432
You‘re a prosecutor.

01:25:00.234 --> 01:25:02.736
Can I... do that?

01:25:04.238 --> 01:25:05.772
Of course you can.

01:25:07.174 --> 01:25:10.010
Excuse me, but that gun is registered?

01:25:12.646 --> 01:25:16.250
Sure.
I always follow the law.

01:25:16.383 --> 01:25:17.150
That‘s good.

01:25:17.417 --> 01:25:19.820
It‘s the voluntary reporting period
for illegal weapons.

01:25:21.221 --> 01:25:28.295
Those are toy guns!
You can try it immediately if you want.

01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:32.399
That knife looks very sharp.

01:25:34.168 --> 01:25:39.540
It‘s used to make Sasimi.
Yeo-soo is famous of fish.

01:25:40.007 --> 01:25:44.011
But some people use that knife on human.

01:25:44.444 --> 01:25:48.282
What? It‘s horrible.

01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:53.854
I‘m an ordinary house wife,
so I only see that in movies.

01:25:55.622 --> 01:25:57.424
Boss, a terrible accident!

01:25:57.558 --> 01:26:00.460
I‘m busy now, talk you later.

01:26:00.727 --> 01:26:03.363
Popeye family attacked the Amazon!

01:26:03.363 --> 01:26:05.399
What? That fucker attacked us?

01:26:06.633 --> 01:26:11.238
He visited us after a long time.
What happened?

01:26:11.238 --> 01:26:14.708
Maybe he came to here to meet Olive.

01:26:14.908 --> 01:26:16.877
Talk to him has a good time.

01:26:17.144 --> 01:26:21.081
Why didn‘t you respond to
that motherfucker‘s attack!

01:26:21.081 --> 01:26:24.117
You‘re a foul-mouthed fucker.

01:26:24.284 --> 01:26:26.153
Go and watch your business.

01:26:26.153 --> 01:26:28.922
Don‘t quarrel with each other.

01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:32.659
Get along together, do some patty-cake.

01:26:34.962 --> 01:26:39.700
- It‘s so strange.
- What?

01:26:40.334 --> 01:26:45.472
You‘re very similar to my old friend.

01:26:45.639 --> 01:26:47.975
Really? What does she do?

01:26:48.175 --> 01:26:52.713
She had a serious relationship with In-jae.

01:26:53.013 --> 01:26:54.915
They almost got engaged...huh!

01:26:55.449 --> 01:26:57.317
Really?

01:26:57.885 --> 01:27:02.556
What am I saying?
Sorry, I‘m crazy.

01:27:03.223 --> 01:27:07.794
I‘ll keep a secret, please tell me.

01:27:09.763 --> 01:27:10.831
OK.

01:27:14.168 --> 01:27:19.072
I met Jin-sook more than
ten years before.

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:23.577
Both of us were very famous in here.

01:27:23.844 --> 01:27:29.049
She and I ran a neck-and-neck race

01:27:30.184 --> 01:27:33.387
when we met.

01:28:16.463 --> 01:28:21.235
After that, I could have
been washed up

01:28:21.535 --> 01:28:25.539
but she didn‘t throw me away.

01:28:26.507 --> 01:28:30.844
She and In-jae are most
famous couple here.

01:28:31.378 --> 01:28:33.347
It‘s combination of male and female boss.

01:28:33.413 --> 01:28:35.415
Nobody could touch them.

01:28:36.650 --> 01:28:40.387
But someday...

01:28:42.623 --> 01:28:45.926
Mugunghaw flower bloom!
You so cute.

01:28:46.226 --> 01:28:48.395
Mugunghaw flower bloom!

01:28:49.696 --> 01:28:51.598
Mugunghaw flower bloom!

01:28:52.533 --> 01:28:54.434
Mugunghaw flower bloom!

01:28:59.106 --> 01:29:00.841
I wish it never happened...

01:29:08.815 --> 01:29:14.588
Why do these damn tears come out.

01:29:15.689 --> 01:29:19.660
Sorry about it.
I miss her so much.

01:29:21.895 --> 01:29:23.730
Good bye, mother.

01:29:23.997 --> 01:29:28.001
OK, take care.
And you call me later.

01:29:28.068 --> 01:29:28.802
Yes, mom.

01:29:30.204 --> 01:29:33.040
- Bye.
- Be careful.

01:29:39.046 --> 01:29:42.216
Is it OK? She‘s a prosecutor.

01:29:42.482 --> 01:29:45.452
It does not matter.
It‘s a family honor.

01:29:45.719 --> 01:29:48.789
She can be the enemy‘s in-Iaw.

01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:52.226
She doesn‘t know about us yet?

01:29:52.993 --> 01:29:56.263
I don‘t know.
If she knows, it will be over.

01:29:56.496 --> 01:30:00.701
Are you fool?
She saw all scumbags in the party hall.

01:30:01.134 --> 01:30:02.870
- Let‘s go inside.
- Yes, mother.

01:30:03.036 --> 01:30:04.238
You go first.

01:30:06.006 --> 01:30:07.875
Do you think I‘m a dupe?

01:30:09.142 --> 01:30:12.279
You think I get deceived forever?

01:30:16.183 --> 01:30:21.288
You get blackmailed from others
and help needy neighbors?

01:30:24.091 --> 01:30:25.058
I‘m sorry.

01:30:26.326 --> 01:30:30.797
Did you sell the nightclub so the profit
could go to your organization?

01:30:31.465 --> 01:30:33.734
I‘m not a genius

01:30:35.469 --> 01:30:40.073
but I know what I have to do for.

01:30:45.546 --> 01:30:48.015
A prosecutor can‘t fail in love
with a gangster.

01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:54.288
So I‘ll have to change.

01:30:54.555 --> 01:30:58.091
How can I believe what you said?

01:30:59.526 --> 01:31:03.797
I love you so much.

01:31:06.767 --> 01:31:09.036
If I do gangster‘s job one more time,

01:31:11.038 --> 01:31:15.742
You can put handcuffs on me.

01:31:40.467 --> 01:31:42.236
Damn it.

01:31:42.603 --> 01:31:45.806
How are you...
What are you doing?

01:31:52.279 --> 01:31:55.816
What are you doing now?
You cannot do this.

01:31:55.916 --> 01:31:56.817
Kyung-jae!

01:31:56.984 --> 01:32:01.021
What‘s that? Tell me.
Do you know what you did?

01:32:01.522 --> 01:32:04.491
Our father achieved all for us.

01:32:05.025 --> 01:32:07.327
How dare you destroy them all?

01:32:07.961 --> 01:32:10.764
You sold the night club and everything.

01:32:10.764 --> 01:32:12.466
Fucking social work organization!

01:32:15.903 --> 01:32:17.532
So how can we live from right now?

01:32:18.505 --> 01:32:21.475
We are on the verge of starvation.

01:32:21.542 --> 01:32:22.543
What the hell is

01:32:22.543 --> 01:32:23.610
social work?

01:32:24.611 --> 01:32:27.514
You‘re a gangster so act like a gangster.

01:32:27.881 --> 01:32:31.685
I‘m not a gangster anymore.

01:32:32.653 --> 01:32:35.255
What? You‘re not a gangster?

01:32:36.423 --> 01:32:39.159
Are you crazy now?

01:32:39.726 --> 01:32:43.197
Whole family is made of gangsters,
why not you?

01:32:43.564 --> 01:32:47.668
You throw the entire family away
for that bitch?

01:33:05.719 --> 01:33:09.223
This tiger is not a tiger anymore.

01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:14.094
I‘ll erase this and erase you.

01:33:26.406 --> 01:33:30.377
- What! What is this?
- What?

01:33:32.746 --> 01:33:37.084
I‘m your brother too!
You don‘t know it?

01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:38.452
So what?

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:49.596
I‘m always an outcast... Damn it.

01:33:52.366 --> 01:33:56.069
What did you say to In-jae?

01:33:58.405 --> 01:34:02.576
Shit, I said I‘ll not betray
family for woman.

01:34:04.044 --> 01:34:10.551
Don‘t make me mad, I‘ll kill you all!

01:34:10.717 --> 01:34:15.422
He‘s also painful.
Try to understand him.

01:34:15.422 --> 01:34:20.727
Damn it, you‘re on his side.
Go to him!

01:34:20.894 --> 01:34:25.799
I‘ll be a lonely gangster
in the wasteland.

01:34:28.502 --> 01:34:30.070
Hey, fucker! Kyung-jae!

01:34:34.408 --> 01:34:36.543
I‘m neutral.

01:34:52.559 --> 01:34:56.296
Boss, we‘re in big trouble.

01:34:56.463 --> 01:34:58.866
Fucking Axes kidnapped your brothers.

01:35:35.102 --> 01:35:36.503
Are you Jang In-jae?

01:35:37.604 --> 01:35:40.073
What bring you here?

01:35:40.908 --> 01:35:43.544
I said let‘s not fight each other.

01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:48.081
Only you said, I‘m not.
I didn‘t agree with you.

01:36:35.863 --> 01:36:38.832
Boss!

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:41.335
Bro, bro.

01:36:45.272 --> 01:36:46.406
You guys OK?

01:36:48.509 --> 01:36:50.444
We came here as soon as possible

01:36:50.577 --> 01:36:52.846
because you‘re kidnapped by Axes.

01:36:53.847 --> 01:36:56.783
They indulge in petty wiles.

01:36:57.951 --> 01:36:59.920
I‘ll kill you all tonight.

01:37:45.933 --> 01:37:47.000
It‘s my job...

01:38:02.549 --> 01:38:06.019
You have the right to remain silent

01:38:07.321 --> 01:38:09.590
and refuse to answer questions.

01:38:15.295 --> 01:38:16.330
Hey, Jin-kyung!

01:38:17.564 --> 01:38:21.034
Why did you hand in your resignation?

01:38:21.602 --> 01:38:23.971
It‘s not your fault! You‘re innocent!

01:38:41.188 --> 01:38:44.458
- You want?
- I quit.

01:38:47.494 --> 01:38:49.963
OK, have a long life.

01:38:52.599 --> 01:38:57.471
Just be careful that you
don‘t get stabbed.

01:38:58.872 --> 01:39:02.442
Anyway why did you fight
with a small fry?

01:39:04.344 --> 01:39:08.215
What a great social worker.

01:39:09.283 --> 01:39:12.152
Hey, look at me and talk.

01:39:12.653 --> 01:39:14.655
Who is the real boss of
your organization?

01:39:15.689 --> 01:39:17.024
It‘s your mother, right?

01:39:19.126 --> 01:39:22.729
It‘s my organization.

01:39:24.298 --> 01:39:26.767
My mom is an old lady,
what can she do?

01:39:27.901 --> 01:39:33.974
And my brothers just own
little shop which I gave.

01:39:34.408 --> 01:39:38.478
You take all blame? I‘m touched.

01:39:39.279 --> 01:39:40.848
That is a gangster‘s oath?

01:39:41.181 --> 01:39:43.217
Not an oath, it‘s the truth.

01:39:44.384 --> 01:39:49.289
So release my brothers
and put me in prison.

01:39:53.827 --> 01:39:55.362
Do you dare to patronize me?

01:40:09.276 --> 01:40:11.078
Jin-kyung, long time no see.

01:40:12.646 --> 01:40:13.814
How are you?

01:40:14.014 --> 01:40:15.415
Are you OK?

01:40:16.884 --> 01:40:22.189
Yes, I‘m sorry.

01:40:22.556 --> 01:40:24.925
Why you say that?

01:40:25.492 --> 01:40:28.629
It‘s totally not your fault.

01:40:29.096 --> 01:40:30.564
Don‘t care.

01:40:31.665 --> 01:40:33.800
What bring you here?

01:40:34.134 --> 01:40:40.073
I received a letter before.
I want give it to you.

01:40:50.284 --> 01:40:54.048
You look so tired, go inside.

01:41:03.964 --> 01:41:07.734
Mom, do you like Jin-kyung?

01:41:09.036 --> 01:41:12.940
I wanna spend my life with her.

01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:15.409
She‘s a very good person.

01:41:17.244 --> 01:41:23.517
Mom, if I get marry her

01:41:24.618 --> 01:41:26.820
I cannot be a gangster anymore.

01:41:27.087 --> 01:41:31.992
A gangster cannot be
a prosecutor‘s husband.

01:41:36.330 --> 01:41:41.134
Actually I started a social
work organization recently.

01:41:41.702 --> 01:41:46.473
So I sold some stores
without your permission.

01:41:49.843 --> 01:41:55.082
I‘m sorry I didn‘t tell you before.

01:41:56.683 --> 01:42:01.421
But how about we‘ll be good people

01:42:02.789 --> 01:42:04.424
from now on?

01:42:05.559 --> 01:42:07.761
- Mother.
- Yes.

01:42:08.662 --> 01:42:09.897
Here‘s water.

01:42:13.867 --> 01:42:16.537
Hey, can you put poultice on my back?

01:42:16.937 --> 01:42:21.375
I feel sharp pains all over my body.

01:42:21.775 --> 01:42:24.011
It‘s so painful.

01:42:24.044 --> 01:42:24.845
OK.

01:42:27.314 --> 01:42:28.949
This part twinges.

01:42:29.449 --> 01:42:36.423
Mother, you suffer from ennui.
Is there anything you wanted to do?

01:42:37.491 --> 01:42:40.627
Tell me if you wanna go somewhere.

01:42:44.464 --> 01:42:47.835
I really wanted to

01:42:48.468 --> 01:42:51.772
go to a public bathhouse.

01:42:53.173 --> 01:42:58.979
But I couldn‘t go there with all
my tattoos for forty years.

01:43:01.081 --> 01:43:02.015
Mother...

01:43:03.884 --> 01:43:09.756
I made my children into gangsters.

01:43:11.925 --> 01:43:19.433
It was all my fault.
I shouldn‘t have done that.

01:43:53.367 --> 01:43:54.701
All rise!

01:44:01.909 --> 01:44:04.845
Mother, where‘s our attorney?

01:44:04.845 --> 01:44:06.079
Shut up.

01:44:07.381 --> 01:44:08.682
What‘s going on?

01:44:09.016 --> 01:44:09.783
Sit down.

01:44:16.089 --> 01:44:18.091
Attorney is not present yet?

01:45:02.402 --> 01:45:04.371
I‘m sorry I‘m late.

01:45:11.678 --> 01:45:15.048
Case number 2005 1325

01:45:15.716 --> 01:45:18.619
The trial is now in session.

01:45:18.852 --> 01:45:22.723
About the matter of violence
for Jang In-jae.

01:45:24.725 --> 01:45:28.028
The accused used violence
against Yun Do-sick and 28

01:45:28.095 --> 01:45:32.332
on the night of the 23rd of June, right?

01:45:33.834 --> 01:45:34.501
Yes.

01:45:35.402 --> 01:45:40.140
The accused also used
violence against Jo Kwang-ki

01:45:40.407 --> 01:45:44.411
at Aquus night club
in Sin-sa Dong, right?

01:45:44.945 --> 01:45:45.579
Yes.

01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:50.450
You ordered it all directly, right?

01:45:50.551 --> 01:45:53.453
No, it was me!
I ordered all of it!

01:45:53.987 --> 01:45:57.090
It‘s not true, it was me!

01:45:57.424 --> 01:46:00.527
No, no, listen to me, please.
It was me!

01:46:01.428 --> 01:46:04.765
Keep quiet or I‘ll order
you out of the room.

01:46:09.403 --> 01:46:12.239
The accused knows
about Sharing Love?

01:46:14.775 --> 01:46:15.475
Yes.

01:46:16.443 --> 01:46:19.079
Can you explain what it is?

01:46:20.881 --> 01:46:23.050
It‘s a social work organization.

01:46:24.084 --> 01:46:26.720
What‘s your position in Sharing Love?

01:46:29.623 --> 01:46:30.858
I‘m a representative.

01:46:32.993 --> 01:46:35.362
‘Sharing Love’ is social organization

01:46:35.429 --> 01:46:38.165
which is founded at 1996.

01:46:39.399 --> 01:46:40.200
After managing

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.502
the ‘Sharing Love’ organization,

01:46:41.835 --> 01:46:47.975
he has changed it from a small
poor community club

01:46:48.342 --> 01:46:50.444
into a large community
service organization.

01:46:57.718 --> 01:47:01.555
This is the contribution data of

01:47:01.688 --> 01:47:04.324
the accused Jan In-jae‘s company.

01:47:05.526 --> 01:47:08.228
Objection! The accused used

01:47:08.228 --> 01:47:12.566
Sharing Love as a front
for criminal enterprise.

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:17.271
Can you explain what it is?

01:47:17.271 --> 01:47:21.175
It is because he wanted to make a

01:47:21.175 --> 01:47:24.611
favorable impression on his
attorney Kim Jin-kyung.

01:47:25.846 --> 01:47:32.085
They‘ve been going out
each other for 3 months.

01:47:32.686 --> 01:47:34.588
So I insist that she has

01:47:35.022 --> 01:47:38.358
no right to defend this case.

01:47:38.892 --> 01:47:40.027
Haven‘t you?

01:47:48.869 --> 01:47:51.939
I have something to tell you.

01:47:52.606 --> 01:47:53.707
Who are you?

01:47:54.474 --> 01:47:58.045
I‘m the one who got a favor from In-jae.

01:48:01.114 --> 01:48:05.853
What are you doing?
I didn‘t do anything.

01:48:07.621 --> 01:48:09.122
It hurts!

01:48:09.556 --> 01:48:13.827
You have two previous convictions
for breaking into safes, right?

01:48:14.561 --> 01:48:16.129
Cock sucker.

01:48:17.931 --> 01:48:23.637
It was so long time ago.
I‘m retired after my marriage.

01:48:24.538 --> 01:48:28.909
Our winning is up to you.
You can do it.

01:49:05.979 --> 01:49:11.818
Yes, there was some
problem between he and I

01:49:11.952 --> 01:49:14.555
so I attempted to meet Jang In-jae.

01:49:15.289 --> 01:49:17.658
But he attacked me that night.

01:49:17.791 --> 01:49:20.961
- Here.
- The whole place was a mess.

01:49:21.495 --> 01:49:23.096
And He broke everything, hit everyone.

01:49:24.364 --> 01:49:26.466
You were so scared.

01:49:26.733 --> 01:49:29.970
Of course, I can‘t even sleep.

01:49:30.170 --> 01:49:31.138
As you heard.

01:49:32.272 --> 01:49:34.708
- Jin-kyung, go for it!
- Go.

01:49:36.677 --> 01:49:38.278
Cross examine, please.

01:49:39.479 --> 01:49:42.576
It‘s occupied... huh? You bitch!

01:49:43.617 --> 01:49:44.451
Talk to you later.

01:49:52.359 --> 01:49:53.694
I would like to produce evidence.

01:49:58.165 --> 01:50:00.200
Hey, this is recording now?

01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:00.901
Yes, boss.

01:50:01.301 --> 01:50:03.103
Why you wanna record this?

01:50:04.972 --> 01:50:06.740
How can we believe prosecutor Bong?

01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.576
I‘m recording this tape in case.

01:50:10.143 --> 01:50:11.712
He cannot betray us!

01:50:13.881 --> 01:50:14.982
So you understand?

01:50:15.048 --> 01:50:18.852
Sure, you want to set a trap
for Jang In-jae.

01:50:19.786 --> 01:50:22.256
Anyway I‘m planning to suck him up.

01:50:23.357 --> 01:50:25.492
Can I believe you?

01:50:26.393 --> 01:50:29.496
Don‘t worry about it.

01:50:29.496 --> 01:50:32.299
Just carry out my order.
And watch your mouth.

01:50:32.733 --> 01:50:34.601
OK, I believe you.

01:50:37.404 --> 01:50:38.038
Sure.

01:50:44.178 --> 01:50:49.750
Your honor! It‘s a trap!
Who is that guy?

01:50:52.186 --> 01:50:53.620
The tape I‘m about to show you

01:50:53.854 --> 01:50:57.424
will embarrass you as it has me.

01:50:58.458 --> 01:51:00.794
Mr. Bong has brought shame

01:51:01.094 --> 01:51:03.630
to all prosecutors

01:51:03.864 --> 01:51:07.201
who work for protecting justice,
I‘m so upset.

01:51:08.735 --> 01:51:10.871
In-jae fell into trap

01:51:11.305 --> 01:51:13.640
just because he was a gangster.

01:51:13.774 --> 01:51:18.212
He is the real victim in this case.

01:51:18.679 --> 01:51:23.717
You‘ve got to investigate Mr. Bong,

01:51:23.717 --> 01:51:26.053
and make sure that
he pays for his crime.

01:51:26.086 --> 01:51:27.254
Our hometown.

01:51:27.421 --> 01:51:33.594
We cannot forgive Mr. Bong!
Motherfucker!

01:51:34.895 --> 01:51:35.796
Yes!

01:51:38.098 --> 01:51:39.933
Stop!

01:52:58.745 --> 01:53:00.414
the ceremony of disbanding

01:53:07.921 --> 01:53:09.723
Be born again

01:53:28.175 --> 01:53:31.478
I don‘t know why I‘m so nervous.

01:53:31.545 --> 01:53:33.313
Don‘t hang your head.

01:53:33.914 --> 01:53:39.286
She was a prosecutor
but we‘re historic family.

01:53:40.621 --> 01:53:43.857
I‘m Hong Duck-ja.

01:53:44.057 --> 01:53:48.395
Sure, women are more
powerful in our family.

01:53:48.962 --> 01:53:51.231
Shut up, bitch!

01:54:02.075 --> 01:54:06.280
Wow, are you Duck-ja?
Hong Duck-ja!

01:54:07.648 --> 01:54:10.150
Sweetheart?

01:54:11.218 --> 01:54:13.387
Mom, today is our day...

01:54:13.453 --> 01:54:18.292
Shut up, I‘m meeting my first love

01:54:18.358 --> 01:54:20.294
so don‘t disturb me.

01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:21.161
What?

01:54:21.261 --> 01:54:27.768
I remember
you were such a cute little girl.

01:54:27.835 --> 01:54:31.205
You were cute too, sweetheart.

01:54:32.573 --> 01:54:35.676
I wanna get married, mom.

01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:39.046
That‘s OK, you have such a boyish face.

01:54:39.179 --> 01:54:41.748
Dad, you don‘t want me to marry?

01:54:41.982 --> 01:54:45.085
You‘re so young, not even thirty.

01:54:45.185 --> 01:54:48.488
We have to reconsider this wedding.

01:54:49.089 --> 01:54:52.559
Hey, let‘s just the two of us talk.

01:54:52.626 --> 01:54:53.694
That‘s good.

01:54:54.494 --> 01:54:56.163
- Dad!
- M... mom!

01:54:56.230 --> 01:54:57.998
Mom!
