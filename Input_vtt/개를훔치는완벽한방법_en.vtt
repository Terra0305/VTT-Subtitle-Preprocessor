00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.671
This is a fable by
a man named Aesop.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:15.008
The hares decided that
they’ve had enough.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.244
Hunted by the lions,

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.181
startled by wolves,

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:26.420
and chased by eagles,
they all wanted to eat them.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:34.995
So rather than living this terrible life,
they decided to jump!
Into the pond and die!

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.534
But when they were falling
into the pond,

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:47.174
the frogs were startled
and jumped out of the water.

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:49.877
The moral of this story is,

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:54.248
there is always someone
worse off than yourself.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:02:00.787
So, don’t be too sad or disappointed
because you’re in a difficult situation.

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:05.859
If Aesop was in my shoes,
could he have written that?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.762
Definitely not.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.635
HOW TO STEAL A DOG

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:17.171
What?!
Getting a divorce?

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:20.908
I knew it,
it doesn’t even surprise me.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:28.382
She won’t accept alimony? Is she nuts?!
The way I see it, she’s the cheater.

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:32.252
There’s evidence,
I heard some things.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.493
That corner store owner...
Holy cow!
Why are they always hiding!

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:46.133
Afternoon, ma’am.
License please.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.868
I only spoke a few words.

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:49.670
License please.

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.740
I only said 2 words,
give me a ticket for that.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.243
You can’t just pick and choose.
- Come on, mister.
- Mom.

00:02:56.243 --> 00:02:58.245
- Come on, mister.
- Mom.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:00.047
It’s embarrassing.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.487
My kid’s embarrassed, bill me for 2 words.
So anal... It’s the law, give it to me already.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.291
- I’ll get off here.
- Where do you always go?

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.993
Your house’s far.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.161
That way.

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:18.031
Ma’am, I’ll get off here.

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:19.533
Okay, take care.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.403
- Whatever, Mr. Johnny Law.
- Don’t call me that, I’m an officer.

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:27.241
- Okay, Mr. Officer, listen.
- Mom, I’ll be back!

00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:29.243
Hey! You got private class!

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.677
Do you know
how much that is?

00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:09.283
$250,000.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.918
Been a while.

00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:14.121
I’m not just managing a restaurant.

00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:18.000
Only the loaded VIPs dine here.

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:23.263
- If we dated like I wanted, you could’ve been...
- Hey, drop it.

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:26.166
When can I start?
I’m in a bit of a rush.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.802
Could you decide soon?

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:32.239
Well, I have the hiring power,

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:35.609
but this is my aunt’s business.

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:39.246
So there’s a protocol.
Let’s see.

00:04:39.413 --> 00:04:40.614
Where’s your address?

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:44.618
Come on, you know me.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.255
- She’s here.
- Hurry up!

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:50.624
Good afternoon, madam.

00:05:03.237 --> 00:05:07.241
She’s interviewing
for the extra hand...

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:11.612
She looks pleasant.

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:17.751
Wolly, let’s go upstairs.

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:22.122
PIZZA HUK

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:33.734
Don’t go there without my permission.
You’re not a beggar!

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:36.003
Who cares if my belly’s full.

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:41.642
You’re wrong!
Did you ever consider how others would see us?

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:47.381
It’s nice to get free stuff with your puppy eyes.
But life isn’t so easy.

00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:50.617
Once you’re ignored,
it’s all over!

00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:51.919
Hey!

00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:58.992
Hi.

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:03.931
I’ve been following you
since the car.

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:11.505
We... we’re...

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:14.641
moving to a bigger house.

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:19.680
- Really?
- Yeah. Dad’s pizza shop’s doing so well.

00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:22.249
I see.

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:27.621
So, we’re staying here
for just one week.

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:29.389
One week?

00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:33.660
The house... isn’t ready...

00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:36.263
Mom left us these for dinner.

00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:41.001
There’s hot water
at the corner store.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.862
You’ll be embarrassed
to be with me.

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:14.234
- My mom’s far more embarrassing.
- We may become homeless.

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:16.403
Maybe we already are.

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:20.641
Your mom won’t let you
play with me.

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:28.615
I won’t hate you for it,
we don’t have to be friends.

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:33.754
Let’s stay friends.

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:36.990
You won’t tell anyone?

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.259
Not even your mom?

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:46.266
Promise.

00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:53.373
I told you I’d get a job
right away.

00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:57.544
- I still got tricks up my sleeve.
- So, when do we buy a house?

00:07:57.544 --> 00:08:00.681
You said it’d a week,
but it’s been a month.

00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:06.253
Go back to daycare,
I’ll pay the overdue fees.

00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:08.121
Say you were on a trip.

00:08:08.288 --> 00:08:09.890
I’m okay.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.794
Go and play there.
That’d be more helpful.

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:16.029
I can at least do that.

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:18.365
Can’t we just go to auntie’s?

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:22.169
- Not that again.
- Because of your pride?

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:23.871
No, it’s not about that!

00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:26.006
Do you even know
what that means?

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:29.009
- I do, thanks to you.
- Seriously!

00:08:31.378 --> 00:08:34.548
What’s wrong? Not good?
Have another.

00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:37.484
Dad’s pizza is
much better.

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:41.555
We decided not to
talk about dad.

00:08:41.622 --> 00:08:46.126
Can’t you bake it,
like dad did?

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:52.165
You know mom can’t cook.
She never cooked for us.

00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:55.302
Not because I can’t!

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.787
You can’t believe
everything moms say.

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:17.291
Not everything they say is true,

00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:21.261
and not everything they do
make sense.

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:25.432
If mom was so smart,
she wouldn’t have married dad.

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:30.003
Before we buy a house,
she’ll drive me insane.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:34.508
It’s not buying,
you get a ‘house deposit’.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:39.112
What’s that?
It’s what adults call it instead.

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:42.182
Is that expensive?

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.384
Probably more than $100?

00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:46.987
Idiots.

00:09:46.987 --> 00:09:51.291
There aren’t any
$100 deposits nowadays.
You girls don’t know anything.

00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:54.361
How much is your house?

00:09:54.528 --> 00:09:56.930
Saw it during
my birthday party, right?

00:09:57.264 --> 00:10:01.301
It’s so much more than $100.
So how much is it?!

00:10:02.503 --> 00:10:04.004
About...

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:05.672
$500?

00:10:07.407 --> 00:10:09.009
$500?!

00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:17.384
Ji-so!

00:10:18.252 --> 00:10:20.287
Did you ask your mom
about your party?

00:10:20.387 --> 00:10:24.658
What? My party?
Yeah, your birthday’s next month.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.160
That’s right.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.132
Didn’t you want to have
a big party like Min-sup?

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.134
Yes.

00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:38.038
You don’t have to.

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:41.041
Why? Who doesn’t like parties?

00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:43.610
I don’t like parties at my place.
It’s like showing off.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.681
Who doesn’t have
a house nowadays?

00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:51.251
I want to do it,
a big party at home.

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:54.788
Yeah? Then have your mom
call me.

00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:57.758
Okay.

00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:00.000
Bye.

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:05.666
But you don’t have a house.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.735
So I have to get one
before then.

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:20.514
Chungdam, Won-dang,
New Villa, Per Square, Il-san...

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:22.883
“HANSAM REAL ESTATE”
I don’t understand this!

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:27.254
This one,
how about this one?

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:29.623
So beautiful!
It’s perfect!

00:11:29.623 --> 00:11:31.425
“$500 PER SQUARE!”
It costs $500 too.

00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:33.760
It costs $500 too.
Perfect!

00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:37.364
But where’s ‘PER SQUARE’?

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:42.002
Well, maybe beside Time Square?

00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:45.239
If so...

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:47.374
it’s a bit far from school.

00:11:47.508 --> 00:11:51.912
But you still have the van,
so it should be okay.

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:57.885
Go away, children.

00:11:58.118 --> 00:12:00.120
Is this house really $500?

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.994
- Where’s your mom?
- Can I really buy this for $500?

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:13.133
- If you want to know, bring your mom.
- Can’t you lower the price?

00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:18.672
$500 per square meter is very cheap.
It’s the best bargain in town.

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:23.510
- That must be really great town.
- Sure.

00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:28.882
$500 PER SQUARE!

00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:34.121
Wait, this isn’t what I ordered.

00:12:34.488 --> 00:12:36.490
You ordered beef tenderloin.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.260
What are you talking about,
I ordered hamburger steak!

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:43.864
- But you...
- Pardon me.

00:12:44.364 --> 00:12:46.166
That’s enough.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.002
Okay, give me more enough.

00:12:49.903 --> 00:12:51.505
I gave you enough.

00:12:52.139 --> 00:12:56.243
- Yes, one more enough.
- You already had enough.

00:12:57.878 --> 00:13:01.782
- We’ll get your order right.
- Will it take a long time?

00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:06.053
- No, we’ll cook it as soon as possible.
- How many kids does she have?!

00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:12.860
Sweetie, did you see me work?

00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:14.628
Look.

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:16.797
Isn’t my uniform pretty?

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.366
Do these look too chic?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.536
Of course they are.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.905
But you sold everything else.

00:13:25.005 --> 00:13:27.174
I’ll buy them again
with the salary.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.112
I’ll keep Ji-suk with me.

00:13:32.246 --> 00:13:36.517
Why don’t you
get the laundry done?

00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:44.124
Buy yourself some snack.

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:47.127
I’m off.

00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:50.130
Mom!

00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:51.765
Do you...

00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:56.870
have $500?

00:13:57.037 --> 00:14:01.508
What are you talking about?
Go on, don’t wander off.

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:19.993
$500 PER SQUARE METER

00:14:21.495 --> 00:14:23.430
BUS #500

00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:27.234
500 YEARS OF
JOSEON DYNASTY

00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:29.736
VITAMIN 500

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.006
HOUSING DEPOSIT
FROM $500

00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:05.239
Come by after.

00:15:05.506 --> 00:15:07.007
Depends.

00:15:12.112 --> 00:15:13.280
Huh?

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:29.496
Mister, I only got 8 coupons.
Can I add $2 and get a family size?

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.032
You know
perfectly well you can’t.

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:37.738
Then I’ll give you 2 extra later,
can’t I get it upfront?

00:15:38.238 --> 00:15:41.041
Who gives
a free pizza upfront?

00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:44.111
Little bugger,
life isn’t free.

00:15:45.546 --> 00:15:48.115
I threw some away
because I didn’t know.

00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:56.490
-You can’t smoke while kneading.
- You still won’t get anything.

00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:05.132
Hello?

00:16:05.432 --> 00:16:07.367
Yes, Gold Villa.

00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:11.872
Yes, family size.
Thank you.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.910
Family size is F,
and regular is R.

00:16:18.412 --> 00:16:20.514
Do you even speak English?

00:16:32.626 --> 00:16:33.627
REWARD: $500

00:16:57.885 --> 00:16:59.419
Do you need this?

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:29.750
I’m so tired...

00:17:43.263 --> 00:17:46.033
How can a dog cost $500?

00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:48.535
It says he guarded the President.

00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:52.139
- It’s exactly $500.
- It’s a God-given chance.

00:17:52.139 --> 00:17:56.410
- We have to find this dog.
- But how do we find him?

00:17:57.744 --> 00:18:00.514
We have to try everything.

00:18:00.547 --> 00:18:04.151
Okay, for $500.
We’ll try everything.

00:18:04.618 --> 00:18:07.754
We can start with
the dog’s neighborhood.

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:12.860
It’s not like dogs can fly,
how far can they go?

00:18:12.993 --> 00:18:17.364
We should call and see
if he’ll really pay $500.

00:18:17.364 --> 00:18:21.301
I’m calling about Jinsam,
the President’s guard dog.

00:18:21.802 --> 00:18:26.006
Will you really pay
$500 to find him?

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.243
You won’t subtract taxes, right?

00:18:30.377 --> 00:18:31.378
What?!

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:34.047
You found him?!

00:18:34.515 --> 00:18:36.517
He was in your front yard?!

00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:43.624
Just how big is your front yard?
You should’ve looked for him there first!

00:18:44.258 --> 00:18:47.027
Why?
I am in primary school.

00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:49.863
Can’t primary students
nitpick too?

00:18:49.863 --> 00:18:50.864
REWARD $500

00:18:50.864 --> 00:18:53.367
Do you know
how disappointed we are?!

00:19:14.388 --> 00:19:15.923
So steep...

00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:36.877
“TOWED VEHICLE LOT”
There’s towing and parking fees,
and the fine is due within 15 days.

00:19:36.877 --> 00:19:41.048
There’s towing and parking fees,
and the fine is due within 15 days.

00:19:42.783 --> 00:19:45.152
- Towing and parking?
- Yes.

00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:51.925
- I’m a bit short on cash, can’t I get a discount?
- No credit card?

00:19:54.928 --> 00:19:57.297
Can I use your phone
for a moment?

00:19:58.265 --> 00:19:59.633
No cellphone either?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.669
We’re homeless,
how can we afford a cellphone!

00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:21.655
Stop that, it’s irritating!

00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:26.360
We were just here.

00:20:28.428 --> 00:20:30.797
How long
are we going to circle?

00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:34.301
Is it my fault that
we got nowhere to go?

00:20:34.868 --> 00:20:38.305
So let’s just go to auntie’s.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.009
I’m really tired,
so don’t annoy me.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.512
If we go there,
you have to transfer too!

00:20:45.512 --> 00:20:50.417
So transfer, it’s no big deal.
Better than living like homeless.

00:20:57.391 --> 00:21:00.160
Where did you
get that stubbornness?!

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:07.134
Feels nice to say anything you want?!
Even if we live in a car,
you must attend a good school!

00:21:07.134 --> 00:21:09.803
You just do
what I tell you!

00:21:09.803 --> 00:21:13.740
Who’s the stubborn one?
Tell me, who?!

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.244
I think you’re both stubborn.

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:25.485
- Do you know what’s coming up next month?
- Sports Day,thought I’d forget?

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:27.254
Seriously.

00:21:29.489 --> 00:21:30.891
Where you going?!

00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:34.494
Hey!

00:21:37.431 --> 00:21:38.866
Get back in here!

00:21:55.382 --> 00:22:00.254
Hey.
So you’ll have your party
at your house?

00:22:02.623 --> 00:22:03.991
Yes...

00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:07.761
Do you live better than us?

00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:09.363
Bigger house?

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:15.636
Min-sup, don’t even compare.

00:22:15.903 --> 00:22:20.541
Compare to hers,
yours is a dog house.

00:22:22.376 --> 00:22:23.911
- Really?
- Min-sup.

00:22:34.288 --> 00:22:38.859
$500 PER SQUARE METER
REWARD $500

00:22:41.495 --> 00:22:42.996
Let’s steal a dog.

00:22:43.263 --> 00:22:46.800
- Steal what?
- Steal a $500 dog.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.506
We’ll steal it and return it.
We will just take the reward money.

00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:58.245
What?
You steal a dog?

00:22:58.412 --> 00:23:00.380
You shut up!

00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:08.488
- Don’t be late!
- Okay!

00:23:10.624 --> 00:23:12.292
Do you have a plan?

00:23:12.492 --> 00:23:14.661
We must find a dog first.

00:23:15.863 --> 00:23:18.131
Aren’t we doing a bad thing?

00:23:18.665 --> 00:23:21.034
So we should only do it once.

00:23:21.235 --> 00:23:24.238
You can’t live
without doing bad things.

00:23:24.238 --> 00:23:26.540
THE PERFECT PLAN
TO STEAL A DOG

00:23:27.374 --> 00:23:29.610
1. Don’t steal from
a super rich family.

00:23:29.776 --> 00:23:33.046
Why?
They can just buy a new one.

00:23:33.247 --> 00:23:36.250
Only somewhat rich family
will be sad to lose a dog.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.152
2. No children’s dog.

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:42.289
3. Steal from people
we wouldn’t feel sorry.

00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:45.859
4. Decent size to run with.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.763
He mustn’t bark too much,
and not bite either.

00:23:49.763 --> 00:23:53.634
5. President’s dogs or
guard dogs are too loud.

00:23:58.005 --> 00:23:58.539
What?

00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:01.141
Do we have to keep
him around?

00:24:01.742 --> 00:24:04.611
He’s the 3rd generation
only son.

00:24:05.045 --> 00:24:10.484
Have to keep him around.
He’s too stupid to be any help.

00:24:10.484 --> 00:24:15.489
People with “suk” in the name
are super stupid.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.792
Come on, that’s not true.

00:24:19.626 --> 00:24:23.797
That’s what my mom said.
Sometimes, she’s right.

00:24:24.932 --> 00:24:27.801
Does you dad’s name
end with “suk”?

00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:29.369
Yeah.

00:24:33.674 --> 00:24:35.542
3rd generation only son?

00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:43.116
Look how fat he is.
Soaked in happiness.

00:24:43.617 --> 00:24:45.886
Can we carry him?

00:24:47.387 --> 00:24:49.990
Maybe for a moment.

00:24:50.123 --> 00:24:54.000
Where’ll you keep him
after stealing him?

00:24:59.366 --> 00:25:02.636
They’ll fit in our bag.

00:25:02.636 --> 00:25:06.240
The owner wouldn’t care
if one of them disappeared.

00:25:07.307 --> 00:25:11.512
If we steal it,
we gotta feed it.

00:25:12.045 --> 00:25:14.615
Got money for dog food?

00:25:15.883 --> 00:25:21.288
- What are you kids doing there?
- Your puppies are really cute. Sorry!

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.630
There are cameras
everywhere now.

00:25:30.264 --> 00:25:32.299
What about those?

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.776
Take this,
and go to mom’s restaurant.

00:25:45.512 --> 00:25:46.747
What’s with you?!

00:25:47.281 --> 00:25:53.387
- It’s not like you need skill to carry dishes.
- I haven’t been sleeping well lately.

00:25:53.654 --> 00:25:54.988
I’ll clean it up.

00:25:55.923 --> 00:25:59.126
You got a knack
for doing a bad job.

00:26:00.627 --> 00:26:02.129
Really?

00:26:02.996 --> 00:26:05.866
You can’t keep bringing
your kids here!

00:26:07.167 --> 00:26:08.235
Ji-suk!

00:26:08.502 --> 00:26:10.003
Maybe it’s my punch out time.

00:26:10.304 --> 00:26:13.173
“Punch out”?
You still got 3 hours left!

00:26:13.307 --> 00:26:16.610
Then I’ll give him some food
and send him away.

00:26:20.113 --> 00:26:21.615
Let’s eat ice cream!

00:26:22.516 --> 00:26:24.384
Choco or strawberry?

00:26:24.618 --> 00:26:27.120
Did you eat?
Let’s get some waffles too.

00:26:30.624 --> 00:26:31.491
Aunt...

00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:36.496
- Good afternoon, madam.
- I heard PARK found YOON’s final piece.

00:26:36.864 --> 00:26:39.633
Yes, it’ll be auctioned off this month.

00:26:39.633 --> 00:26:43.303
- Very good. Get it and put it in my room.
- Yes, ma’am.

00:26:43.303 --> 00:26:49.910
Oh yeah, Mr. PARK mentioned your will...
What does he mean...

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.880
Something’s odd,
why does it feel so weird?

00:26:54.882 --> 00:26:57.251
Should we change
the interior design?

00:26:57.885 --> 00:26:59.052
Forget it.

00:27:09.129 --> 00:27:10.764
Let’s drink water.

00:27:11.031 --> 00:27:12.499
Wait.

00:27:15.135 --> 00:27:19.006
Tell PARK not to worry
because it’s the last time.

00:27:19.239 --> 00:27:24.044
How can an asset manager tremble
over a painting’s price tag?

00:27:25.913 --> 00:27:29.283
But it’s in the hundreds
and thousands...

00:27:31.618 --> 00:27:34.988
There’s just one more,
then it’s over.

00:27:37.658 --> 00:27:42.763
How about what PARK
proposed last time?
Rebuilding this place.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:47.301
A skyscraper here would
multiply the profit...

00:27:47.301 --> 00:27:49.002
- Su-young.
- Yes?

00:27:49.369 --> 00:27:52.239
Do you know why
dog’s better than men?

00:27:53.407 --> 00:27:55.742
They don’t talk,
not a word.

00:28:00.113 --> 00:28:02.616
Tell him I’ll contact him
when the will is done.

00:28:02.883 --> 00:28:05.385
You’ll... finally complete it?

00:28:05.485 --> 00:28:07.387
What’s with you?
Move aside!

00:28:13.861 --> 00:28:15.262
So weird...

00:28:17.631 --> 00:28:19.032
I understand, madam.

00:28:22.503 --> 00:28:28.509
- That dog belongs to very rich family, right?
- Yeah, and my mom works there.

00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:31.745
- Really?
- Wanna have ice cream there?

00:28:31.879 --> 00:28:33.413
Can we really?

00:28:33.413 --> 00:28:38.886
Mom doesn’t get paid much,
so we eat there often.

00:28:39.419 --> 00:28:42.489
You’ll get $500,000
to work with.

00:28:42.656 --> 00:28:44.791
You can proceed with that.

00:28:46.627 --> 00:28:48.128
I told you already.

00:28:49.162 --> 00:28:50.998
Measly $500...

00:28:52.132 --> 00:28:55.135
Why do you make me
repeat myself?

00:28:57.304 --> 00:28:59.039
Fine.

00:29:02.743 --> 00:29:04.912
Why aren’t we going?

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.293
Where’s your mom?

00:29:20.127 --> 00:29:22.129
What the heck are you doing?!

00:29:22.262 --> 00:29:27.868
- I’m sorry, just this once.
- Are you nuts? Why bathe him here?!

00:29:28.001 --> 00:29:29.002
Then could you?

00:29:29.136 --> 00:29:33.006
Help me out for one more day.
I won’t bring him from tomorrow on.

00:29:33.006 --> 00:29:38.178
We barely get 10 people a day,
it’s not like your hands are full.

00:29:38.412 --> 00:29:42.516
There’re more employees than customers.
Don’t be so stern.

00:29:42.516 --> 00:29:46.787
Am I the boss here?
If it wasn’t for my aunt, I wouldn’t be.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.758
I hear she’s using this place
to meet people, not for business.

00:29:52.125 --> 00:29:57.764
Don’t be so stern for
eating leftovers and using water.

00:29:58.265 --> 00:30:03.737
Not a shred of humanity,
despite doing charity on the side.

00:30:04.004 --> 00:30:08.609
If you can’t say that to my aunt,
then don’t say it to my face!

00:30:09.276 --> 00:30:12.746
I don't know if I’m working,
or being a housewife.

00:30:13.247 --> 00:30:15.115
You see how impossible
she is?

00:30:15.616 --> 00:30:20.053
No wonder her husband left her,
and her only son left home and died.

00:30:20.053 --> 00:30:24.057
If I wasn’t the only one
to inherit Marcel, I’d have left.

00:30:29.863 --> 00:30:31.765
So righteous.

00:30:34.668 --> 00:30:36.036
You got it all wrong.

00:30:36.637 --> 00:30:39.740
- Go apologize!
- I’m so sorry, madam!

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.775
- She’s a friend...
- Kick her out.

00:30:41.775 --> 00:30:45.012
- I’m really sorry, I truly am...
- Aunt!

00:30:47.548 --> 00:30:53.787
Honestly, I don’t think
I’m cut out for service work.
This is good!

00:30:53.987 --> 00:30:56.623
I missed out on so many things
while raising you two.

00:30:56.623 --> 00:31:00.160
I’ll now look for
my true calling.

00:31:00.861 --> 00:31:01.929
Oh yeah!

00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:06.000
I got plenty of severance,
should we go to a hotel?

00:31:07.034 --> 00:31:07.868
Should we?

00:31:18.512 --> 00:31:22.249
A man named Aesop showed up
in my dreams recently.

00:31:22.783 --> 00:31:28.055
He wanted to tell me
‘the Hares and the Frogs’.

00:31:28.121 --> 00:31:31.925
I said I didn’t want to hear
the stupid tale.

00:31:33.126 --> 00:31:39.132
It’s only fair when a hare is
compared to another hare.

00:31:40.534 --> 00:31:44.671
In the end,
Aesop apologized to me.

00:31:45.038 --> 00:31:50.277
He said I was the most pitiful one,
not the hares nor the frogs.

00:31:50.544 --> 00:31:55.682
He wouldn’t have written
the story if he met me.

00:32:16.503 --> 00:32:19.506
Other kids will never know,

00:32:19.873 --> 00:32:23.277
how happy it is
to have a home.

00:32:27.014 --> 00:32:29.750
You wanna be called
a ‘stupid dad’?

00:32:30.017 --> 00:32:32.753
Would you understand
if I explained?

00:32:33.253 --> 00:32:35.255
Do you even know
what her belt is?

00:32:36.123 --> 00:32:37.391
Yellow, it’s yellow!

00:32:37.558 --> 00:32:42.000
What I’m saying is,
we can’t afford it right now.

00:32:42.262 --> 00:32:47.634
She attends private classes
but always dead last.
Listen to yourself!

00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:49.870
And she’s a red belt!

00:32:55.042 --> 00:32:56.009
Hey.

00:32:56.276 --> 00:32:58.278
I’ve decided on the dog.

00:32:58.745 --> 00:32:59.680
Marcel?

00:33:10.057 --> 00:33:17.664
Okay.
He always has a leash,
and is freed only at the vet
once a day.

00:33:18.165 --> 00:33:23.003
No chance between
the restaurant and the clinic.

00:33:23.003 --> 00:33:26.006
He always goes there
at this hour?

00:33:26.306 --> 00:33:27.307
Yup.

00:33:28.609 --> 00:33:31.245
Then let’s do it there.

00:33:32.012 --> 00:33:34.248
There’ll be too many eyes,
will it be okay?

00:33:34.548 --> 00:33:35.282
Yeah.

00:33:35.282 --> 00:33:43.123
It’ll take about 2 hours for check-up,
exercise, massage, and grooming.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:50.364
Mr. Su-young is always too busy
chatting with nurses,
so he’s not a problem.

00:33:51.265 --> 00:33:55.869
The problem is how to lure him
to end of the hallway.

00:33:55.869 --> 00:33:58.505
How do we lure him
from here to here?

00:33:58.639 --> 00:34:00.807
Can’t we just carry him out?

00:34:02.409 --> 00:34:05.012
Just carry him out?

00:34:05.913 --> 00:34:09.283
There, and there,
people can see you clearly.

00:34:09.416 --> 00:34:13.887
- Don’t you lure it with food?
- So strange...

00:34:14.254 --> 00:34:18.125
A “suk” kid should be
really stupid.

00:34:18.492 --> 00:34:21.028
He still can’t write
alphabet yet.

00:34:21.361 --> 00:34:25.866
So did you find a place
to keep him?

00:34:31.872 --> 00:34:33.373
How cool am I?

00:34:34.241 --> 00:34:36.743
- Awesome...
- Perfect, right?

00:34:36.743 --> 00:34:38.011
Too perfect.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.013
There’s more.

00:34:43.617 --> 00:34:44.384
Watch.

00:34:55.162 --> 00:34:56.864
So amazing!

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:59.766
We just have to
steal him now.

00:35:00.167 --> 00:35:02.369
Wait for it, coming soon!

00:35:08.876 --> 00:35:09.910
Tada!

00:35:11.378 --> 00:35:15.249
But she loves Marcel
too much.

00:35:15.249 --> 00:35:19.786
We’re not talking about selling it.
Not sell, but invest in it.

00:35:19.786 --> 00:35:21.655
You know I want to.

00:35:21.655 --> 00:35:24.791
But it’s not mine,
what can I do?

00:35:25.659 --> 00:35:28.495
Madam’s finishing her will.

00:35:28.862 --> 00:35:32.633
You can proceed if Marcel is
listed as your inheritance.

00:35:33.901 --> 00:35:35.903
- Seriously?
- Of course!

00:35:35.903 --> 00:35:42.509
All you need are notarized will
property deed and your consent form.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.513
How do I convince her then?

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:53.153
Use your head for once.
When we break ground,
send her off to a senior home.

00:35:53.554 --> 00:35:55.389
No, I can’t.

00:35:55.556 --> 00:35:59.159
There’s auction next month
and when she finishes the will,

00:35:59.626 --> 00:36:00.994
let’s speak again then.

00:36:00.994 --> 00:36:03.931
What a coward!

00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:07.734
This area is being redeveloped,
this is the only chance.

00:36:07.734 --> 00:36:15.008
She’s so hung up
on the paintings
that she’ll go broke soon.

00:36:22.115 --> 00:36:24.985
Do you know
what time is it?!

00:36:25.419 --> 00:36:29.556
I had work to do,
just like you.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.926
But you can’t stay out
so late!

00:36:33.794 --> 00:36:36.630
I had things to
take care of.

00:36:38.632 --> 00:36:41.502
Fine, fine,
no more nagging today.

00:36:43.003 --> 00:36:45.005
Because today is
a happy day!

00:36:47.875 --> 00:36:51.512
I found us a home!
Really?

00:36:55.115 --> 00:36:56.917
We’re here!

00:37:09.496 --> 00:37:12.499
It’s my friend’s,
and it’s empty.

00:37:12.866 --> 00:37:18.305
She said we can use it
for a month or so.
Come in.

00:37:19.373 --> 00:37:20.741
Come!

00:37:40.761 --> 00:37:44.531
I always dreamt of
living in a proper house.

00:37:46.366 --> 00:37:49.803
So many rooms!
You can each use one.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:54.908
It’s scary as is,
but sleep alone?

00:37:59.746 --> 00:38:02.616
It’s got water!
I didn’t expect this!

00:38:02.616 --> 00:38:06.000
Mom, turn it off,
it sounds scary.

00:38:13.861 --> 00:38:15.128
Where are you going?

00:38:16.263 --> 00:38:18.632
- I’m gonna sleep in the van.
- Me too.

00:38:21.235 --> 00:38:23.737
Come here right this second!

00:38:23.871 --> 00:38:25.672
Why won’t you listen to me!

00:38:26.139 --> 00:38:28.242
It’s a really great house!

00:38:28.675 --> 00:38:29.409
Hey!

00:38:31.111 --> 00:38:32.112
Hey!

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.517
I won’t let you in,
even if you wanted to come in.

00:38:36.617 --> 00:38:43.156
It’s so nice here!
This is so soft!
Nice and cozy!

00:38:44.758 --> 00:38:46.493
I heard you got a house.

00:38:46.994 --> 00:38:49.363
It’s not a house.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.998
What do we do?

00:38:51.798 --> 00:38:54.134
- Let’s do it today.
- Today?

00:38:54.735 --> 00:38:56.003
Yeah, today.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.872
Can we do it before
private class ends?

00:38:59.039 --> 00:39:03.610
My mom’s taking interest
in me lately for some reason.

00:39:03.744 --> 00:39:06.880
When does the class end?
5 o’clock.

00:39:07.881 --> 00:39:09.883
30 minutes is enough.

00:39:11.652 --> 00:39:12.753
Faster!

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:37.377
Yes, you can come
and make a reservation.

00:39:53.126 --> 00:39:55.262
Wolly’s done!
Off you go!

00:40:33.367 --> 00:40:34.401
Okay, let’s go.

00:40:46.613 --> 00:40:49.516
He’s here!
Ji-so, pull it!

00:40:52.886 --> 00:40:54.388
Now, close it.

00:40:58.125 --> 00:41:00.127
- Grab him now!
- I got him!

00:41:01.261 --> 00:41:02.529
Just let go!

00:41:05.499 --> 00:41:07.234
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:10.304
- Where is he going?!
- Grab him! Grab him!

00:41:11.238 --> 00:41:13.740
- He’s heading outside!
- No!

00:41:42.236 --> 00:41:43.637
Hey, Wolly.

00:41:45.138 --> 00:41:46.740
Why’re you down here?

00:41:48.542 --> 00:41:50.377
That stupid mutt!

00:41:56.116 --> 00:41:57.384
Ji-so!

00:42:00.787 --> 00:42:03.123
What’s wrong?
Something happened?

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.492
It was a hard day.

00:42:07.861 --> 00:42:11.431
You can wash up at the house.
We get water there.

00:42:11.431 --> 00:42:13.000
Stop it, mom.

00:42:14.801 --> 00:42:16.136
What’s all this?

00:42:18.138 --> 00:42:22.009
I did some shopping!
To decorate our home!
Look at this!

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.613
Tada!
Home sweet home!

00:42:38.025 --> 00:42:40.427
That brat, so difficult...

00:42:42.629 --> 00:42:46.133
NO TRESPASSING
YOU WILL BE MURDERED

00:43:00.781 --> 00:43:04.484
Give me a break!
It’s vacant anyways!

00:44:33.807 --> 00:44:37.611
My new job starts early,
so take care of Ji-suk.

00:44:39.613 --> 00:44:41.381
What kind of job?

00:44:43.016 --> 00:44:48.121
You don’t need to know.
Stay with him in the van
after school. Got it?

00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:54.000
I’m really tired,
good night.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.155
THE PERFECT PLAN #2

00:45:56.123 --> 00:45:59.626
We’ll observe it
under the microscope.

00:46:01.428 --> 00:46:04.865
Let’s forget the clinic,
it’s too dangerous.

00:46:06.366 --> 00:46:09.136
... put it on top of it nicely.

00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:13.540
Marcel’s more dangerous.

00:46:15.409 --> 00:46:19.746
That mutt is strong,
we may need help.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.383
Bringing someone else in is
too dangerous.

00:46:23.383 --> 00:46:30.624
Marcel’s our last chance.
We need an inside man.
Maybe Ji-suk remembers.

00:46:30.757 --> 00:46:32.426
He was inside.

00:46:33.994 --> 00:46:38.632
Granny’s not there during lunch,
Wolly’s alone.

00:46:38.632 --> 00:46:41.001
But 2 people here.

00:46:44.238 --> 00:46:51.612
- Why didn’t you tell us earlier?
- You never asked me. Not even once.

00:46:52.279 --> 00:46:59.052
Let’s use the same plan as before.
We still got dog food left, so it’ll work.

00:46:59.052 --> 00:47:03.257
Once we get him outside...
we need to bring him here.

00:47:04.258 --> 00:47:07.861
But how’ll you bring
the dog from there?

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.369
We need a delivery man.

00:47:15.736 --> 00:47:17.137
Delivery...

00:47:18.005 --> 00:47:19.239
Delivery man.

00:47:21.175 --> 00:47:23.877
No questions, no whining,
just deliver?

00:47:25.112 --> 00:47:28.682
- Why should I?
- Why do you use ‘R’ for family size?

00:47:28.916 --> 00:47:35.389
- What?
- We calculated how much
you pocketedwith that scheme.

00:47:37.424 --> 00:47:39.993
I don’t know
what you’re talking about.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.496
- I’ll spank you!
- We’ll keep this a secret.

00:47:42.496 --> 00:47:46.366
You are doing something very bad.

00:47:46.366 --> 00:47:50.003
Think of it was a punishment
for your crime.

00:47:51.038 --> 00:47:55.008
- It’s terrible to threaten an adult.
- Whatever.

00:47:58.879 --> 00:48:00.681
Okay, go.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.261
Here!

00:48:15.362 --> 00:48:16.663
4:32!

00:48:16.663 --> 00:48:18.031
- Happy?
- Perfect!

00:48:19.166 --> 00:48:20.367
If you shave 2 seconds.

00:48:23.537 --> 00:48:24.371
Will?

00:48:24.371 --> 00:48:28.542
Yes, madam’s.
It should be on her desk,
go check.

00:48:42.756 --> 00:48:44.625
Full inheritance to Wolly?

00:48:48.262 --> 00:48:49.363
Wait...

00:48:50.364 --> 00:48:52.499
Can she leave inheritance
to a dog?

00:48:52.499 --> 00:48:55.402
Laws don’t allow leaving
inheritance to an animal.

00:48:55.736 --> 00:48:57.504
It will need a caretaker.

00:48:59.806 --> 00:49:02.776
CARETAKER: JUNG SU-YOUNG

00:49:03.243 --> 00:49:05.245
I’m designated as the caretaker.

00:49:05.546 --> 00:49:09.116
- Is that okay then?
- That’s the problem.

00:49:09.616 --> 00:49:12.553
Who’ll entrust redevelopment
to a dog caretaker?

00:49:12.553 --> 00:49:15.989
You’re just a caretaker,
you don’t have any rights.

00:49:16.657 --> 00:49:20.661
- So what do I do?
- Let’s do it this way.

00:49:20.761 --> 00:49:24.000
Bring me her seal,
I’ll take care of the rest.

00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:28.302
- Her seal?
- Yeah, let’s get things moving
under her name.

00:49:28.302 --> 00:49:31.004
You should get rid of
the dog.

00:49:31.738 --> 00:49:37.778
- How can I just get rid of it?
- You’re no better than a dog,
will you die as a mutt walker?

00:49:37.878 --> 00:49:40.881
Forget it!
I’ll take care of everything!

00:49:44.651 --> 00:49:45.619
What the heck!

00:49:49.489 --> 00:49:52.626
It’s gone...
Where did it go?

00:49:54.027 --> 00:49:56.163
He must have taken it.

00:49:58.999 --> 00:50:01.368
Mister!
You can’t take that...

00:50:01.869 --> 00:50:03.871
Mister, don’t take that!

00:50:05.305 --> 00:50:05.739
What?

00:50:06.006 --> 00:50:09.776
I know him,
he only has 3 fingers.

00:50:11.512 --> 00:50:15.415
So what do we do?
Where can we hide Wolly?

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:25.759
DOG HIDING PLACE

00:50:26.293 --> 00:50:28.662
Come on!

00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:32.266
Sis.

00:50:35.636 --> 00:50:39.006
- What?
- There is one place
to hide Wolly.

00:50:39.006 --> 00:50:40.140
Where?

00:50:40.874 --> 00:50:44.011
You know, there.

00:50:44.912 --> 00:50:47.247
Right...

00:50:47.514 --> 00:50:48.382
there.

00:50:52.486 --> 00:50:53.887
DOG HIDING PLACE

00:51:09.303 --> 00:51:09.736
Here.

00:51:10.737 --> 00:51:14.508
Are you training me
like a mutt?!
We had to change our plan.

00:51:16.043 --> 00:51:19.613
I’ll get in trouble if it takes
more than 30 minutes!

00:51:19.613 --> 00:51:22.516
If it takes more than 30,
my mom will kill me!

00:51:25.619 --> 00:51:26.987
Let’s begin.

00:51:39.499 --> 00:51:43.003
- Hello, did you make a reservation?
- Yes.

00:52:38.292 --> 00:52:39.259
Sweetie!

00:52:40.027 --> 00:52:42.763
Aren’t you ordering?
Your parents already did.

00:52:46.366 --> 00:52:50.504
Give me the best,
bloodiest steak.

00:52:50.504 --> 00:52:53.240
And a bottle of the most
expensive wine here.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:56.543
It’s their wedding anniversary.

00:53:21.635 --> 00:53:24.037
One, two, three!

00:54:08.048 --> 00:54:10.617
Where are you off to?

00:54:25.666 --> 00:54:26.867
It’s over.

00:54:26.867 --> 00:54:29.870
Maybe he’s going to
the clinic early.

00:54:31.038 --> 00:54:32.239
Give it here.

00:54:32.739 --> 00:54:33.907
- Hey!
- What?

00:54:33.907 --> 00:54:38.512
Wait, that’s weird.
Why put him in the trunk?

00:54:38.512 --> 00:54:39.112
Seal?

00:54:39.112 --> 00:54:42.182
- You’re right.
- Oh right, in her office.

00:54:42.516 --> 00:54:44.618
- Come on, go get it!
- Wait here.

00:54:57.998 --> 00:54:58.999
This button?

00:55:09.276 --> 00:55:11.011
Okay, I hear you.

00:55:11.245 --> 00:55:14.014
I’ll keep in touch,
just sit back and wait.

00:55:14.181 --> 00:55:15.182
See you.

00:55:15.883 --> 00:55:16.917
Bye, Wolly!

00:55:37.137 --> 00:55:38.138
Here!

00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:42.509
- Okay.
- As of now, we don’t know each other.

00:55:42.509 --> 00:55:43.877
Keep your word.

00:55:44.111 --> 00:55:45.012
Okay.

00:55:45.279 --> 00:55:47.014
Don’t even come say hello.

00:55:56.123 --> 00:55:58.859
I thought he’d be
a fancy dog.

00:55:59.126 --> 00:56:03.630
Maybe even rich people
want ordinary things.

00:56:16.877 --> 00:56:17.511
Wow!

00:56:26.286 --> 00:56:27.788
YOON Su-oh?

00:56:45.138 --> 00:56:46.507
Su-young?

00:56:48.509 --> 00:56:50.110
Have you seen Wolly?

00:56:51.111 --> 00:56:51.879
Pardon?

00:56:52.112 --> 00:56:55.282
Are you deaf?
Who unleashed Wolly?

00:56:55.883 --> 00:56:59.486
- Well... who could it be?
- I...

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:04.124
I saw Wolly going towards
the door earlier.

00:57:06.493 --> 00:57:08.295
Are you blind too?

00:57:09.129 --> 00:57:12.766
If you’re a bad manager,
be useful in something else!

00:57:21.275 --> 00:57:24.111
Don’t just stand there,
spread out and find him!

00:57:37.491 --> 00:57:38.625
Are you all right?

00:57:40.928 --> 00:57:41.862
Where’s Wolly?

00:57:42.629 --> 00:57:44.765
Well... not yet...

00:57:52.239 --> 00:57:53.240
Go downstairs.

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:56.543
- You should go to the hospital.
- I’m fine, go away.

00:58:04.117 --> 00:58:05.118
Should I...

00:58:06.053 --> 00:58:08.789
make a report to the police?

00:58:09.256 --> 00:58:09.923
Forget it.

00:58:10.424 --> 00:58:14.494
Man or animal,
I won’t look for those who left.

00:58:15.796 --> 00:58:16.930
I see.

00:58:18.131 --> 00:58:19.499
As you wish.

00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:34.515
Yes, Mr. PARK.

00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:38.552
It’ll all work out,
just like you said.

00:58:39.386 --> 00:58:40.287
What?

00:58:43.557 --> 00:58:45.025
Wolly’s gone?

00:58:46.293 --> 00:58:50.430
What are you talking about?!
What if he suddenly pops up?

00:58:54.034 --> 00:58:56.904
Don’t just say it’ll be okay!

00:58:57.237 --> 00:58:58.238
What?

00:58:59.139 --> 00:59:00.040
Hello?

00:59:00.908 --> 00:59:02.009
Hello?

00:59:06.613 --> 00:59:09.116
We have to go,
mom’ll look for us.

00:59:09.116 --> 00:59:14.121
- Leave Wolly here alone?
- There’s no place better.

00:59:14.121 --> 00:59:20.994
No one will find Wolly.
He’s safe from rain,
and he won’t stay long.

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:25.265
Mom’s waiting!

00:59:26.033 --> 00:59:30.504
Wolly, hold on, okay?

00:59:30.537 --> 00:59:31.905
Promise.

00:59:32.239 --> 00:59:35.375
Flyers will be up tomorrow,
so don’t worry.

00:59:35.509 --> 00:59:37.744
Then he’ll head home.

00:59:50.924 --> 00:59:57.531
As I left him behind,
I saw a familiar look.

00:59:57.998 --> 01:00:03.804
It was my window reflection
when I first slept in the van.

01:00:04.371 --> 01:00:07.374
But that’s not important.

01:00:08.609 --> 01:00:16.116
The plan was perfect
and I’ll demand a $500 reward,
and I’ll buy a house.

01:00:16.517 --> 01:00:24.658
I’ll happily invite my friends
to my birthday,
and have a big party there.

01:00:40.541 --> 01:00:43.377
That’s... my dog!

01:00:48.115 --> 01:00:50.150
It’s mine!

01:00:52.619 --> 01:00:54.121
Fine, I hear you.

01:00:55.122 --> 01:00:57.758
Why did you
throw him away?

01:01:00.027 --> 01:01:04.431
I didn’t,
I’m just keeping it here.

01:01:09.736 --> 01:01:11.038
What’s his name?

01:01:12.306 --> 01:01:14.374
- Wolly.
- Wolly?

01:01:15.676 --> 01:01:18.178
So why do you
keep him here?

01:01:20.514 --> 01:01:21.515
It’s just...

01:01:24.751 --> 01:01:30.757
the landlord doesn’t allow pets.
Only till we move.

01:01:39.132 --> 01:01:41.735
Weird, that’s really weird.

01:01:43.871 --> 01:01:45.038
What is?

01:01:45.305 --> 01:01:48.375
When you become a landlord,
do you hate dogs,

01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:51.245
or when you hate dogs,
you become a landlord?

01:01:51.245 --> 01:01:53.013
Mister, did you sleep here?!

01:01:53.747 --> 01:01:55.749
You can’t sleep here!

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.485
Didn’t you see that?

01:01:59.119 --> 01:02:02.556
I saw,
that’s why I slept outside.

01:02:04.992 --> 01:02:06.994
Will you sleep here again?

01:02:06.994 --> 01:02:11.765
Who knows,
I sleep wherever I feel like.
Why?

01:02:11.765 --> 01:02:13.667
Don’t you have a house?

01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:20.007
Wherever I set my foot
is my house.

01:02:29.383 --> 01:02:31.485
Whoa,
what happened?

01:02:33.787 --> 01:02:36.123
That 3-finger man?

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.762
What do we do now?

01:02:41.929 --> 01:02:44.264
Find Wolly’s rewards flyer.

01:02:55.008 --> 01:02:56.777
Maybe they got
a new dog.

01:02:57.010 --> 01:03:00.514
That’s impossible.
Should we steal another?

01:03:02.516 --> 01:03:08.055
Should we go to Marcel?
No, I got private class.

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:12.426
MARCEL IS TEMPORARILY CLOSED

01:03:20.667 --> 01:03:22.503
What? You saw Wolly?

01:03:23.871 --> 01:03:25.305
How do you know him?

01:03:25.806 --> 01:03:28.876
Answer me,
you never saw him before.

01:03:29.042 --> 01:03:33.113
I did! When mom was fired!
From that window.

01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:35.616
So, where is he now?

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:37.417
Who knows?

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:42.489
If you want,
I could find him for you.

01:03:43.257 --> 01:03:47.794
Thanks for your concern,
but she doesn’t want him now.

01:03:47.794 --> 01:03:48.762
What?

01:03:49.496 --> 01:03:52.866
- She doesn’t want Wolly?
- That’s right.

01:03:53.867 --> 01:03:54.635
Why?

01:03:54.735 --> 01:03:56.803
Who knows?
Go away.

01:03:56.904 --> 01:03:58.038
Now!

01:04:00.908 --> 01:04:02.543
Go back to your mom!

01:04:02.876 --> 01:04:07.014
And don’t come back.
You shouldn’t be here.
Go away!

01:04:07.548 --> 01:04:09.383
What happened to Wolly?

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.389
Where did you see him?

01:04:17.558 --> 01:04:19.860
Front of my school.

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.628
Was it really Wolly?

01:04:22.362 --> 01:04:24.000
Yes, I’m sure.

01:04:24.364 --> 01:04:25.632
His ears...

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.136
were like this,
and his mouth...

01:04:30.637 --> 01:04:31.738
was like this?

01:04:32.739 --> 01:04:36.276
Or this?
Anyway, you lost him, right?

01:04:36.276 --> 01:04:40.013
I didn’t lose him,
he left home.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.116
No, he could be lost!

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:45.619
He left with his own 4 feet!

01:04:46.653 --> 01:04:50.390
- In time, they all leave...
- You’re wrong!

01:04:54.628 --> 01:04:56.864
How would you know that?

01:04:58.999 --> 01:05:01.735
- It’s...
- How do you know?

01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:11.111
My dad’s lost too.

01:05:17.284 --> 01:05:22.256
- Did he leave home?
- No, he didn’t leave home...

01:05:22.389 --> 01:05:24.791
Well, he did...

01:05:24.892 --> 01:05:28.362
but I think he’s lost
and can’t find home.

01:05:28.529 --> 01:05:33.367
But one day,
he’ll find his way back.

01:05:34.501 --> 01:05:36.136
Same with Wolly.

01:05:37.804 --> 01:05:40.174
You really think so?

01:05:40.374 --> 01:05:41.141
Yes.

01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:45.245
Then what should I do?

01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:48.882
You must reach out!
By posting flyers.

01:05:48.916 --> 01:05:50.150
Flyers?

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:53.620
Yes, that’s right.
With Wolly’s information.

01:05:54.888 --> 01:05:57.624
And reward...

01:05:57.891 --> 01:05:59.159
Reward?

01:06:01.028 --> 01:06:02.663
How much would do?

01:06:05.132 --> 01:06:06.266
$500!

01:06:17.611 --> 01:06:22.249
- Hear that? Do what she says.
- What?

01:06:23.116 --> 01:06:24.885
Go on, do what she says.

01:06:26.553 --> 01:06:28.889
500 is too much
for a reward!

01:06:29.056 --> 01:06:32.926
Of course not,
for someone who loves her dog,

01:06:32.926 --> 01:06:37.497
they’d probably pay
10, 20 times more.

01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:40.868
That’s what gets me.

01:06:41.502 --> 01:06:44.137
Leaving inheritance to a dog...

01:06:45.372 --> 01:06:47.140
Here, your phone number.

01:06:51.011 --> 01:06:52.279
MARCEL PHONE NUMBER

01:06:56.383 --> 01:07:01.288
PHONE NUMBER

01:07:04.391 --> 01:07:07.160
Here, make some copies.

01:07:09.263 --> 01:07:10.163
Happy?

01:07:12.032 --> 01:07:15.903
Since I came all the way,
could I get some ice cream?

01:07:16.503 --> 01:07:20.007
- What?
- And one for my brother too?

01:07:20.741 --> 01:07:23.777
You’re a clone of
your mom.

01:07:27.548 --> 01:07:29.416
Bring her two ice creams.

01:07:34.388 --> 01:07:36.156
What are you doing?

01:07:36.623 --> 01:07:38.859
I’m making a house for Wolly.

01:07:38.992 --> 01:07:40.994
Who asked you to do that?

01:07:41.161 --> 01:07:43.530
You don’t want me
making it for him?

01:07:48.735 --> 01:07:50.237
Hold this.

01:07:55.175 --> 01:07:58.178
How much do
I have to pay you?

01:07:59.246 --> 01:08:00.013
What?

01:08:01.782 --> 01:08:04.284
How much will
this cost me?

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.257
If I say I want a lot,

01:08:10.624 --> 01:08:12.993
would you give me that?

01:08:14.494 --> 01:08:16.029
You don’t have to, then.

01:08:16.496 --> 01:08:18.298
So you’re building it
for free?

01:08:18.298 --> 01:08:21.869
Yeah, I’m like that.
I fix laundry machines,

01:08:23.003 --> 01:08:25.639
- fix bikes too.
- For free?

01:08:27.007 --> 01:08:27.875
Why?

01:08:30.878 --> 01:08:33.614
Because more than
I need money,

01:08:33.881 --> 01:08:37.784
some people need
their problems solved right away.

01:08:37.918 --> 01:08:39.119
No way.

01:08:40.287 --> 01:08:43.056
You couldn’t fix our van,
if it breaks.

01:08:43.757 --> 01:08:46.493
Only my dad can fix
the pizza van.

01:08:53.867 --> 01:08:57.638
When I was in the alley
off the main street,

01:08:57.871 --> 01:09:00.507
there was a flyer
for a lost dog.

01:09:02.109 --> 01:09:03.177
What?

01:09:03.610 --> 01:09:07.247
It looked similar to your dog.

01:09:09.116 --> 01:09:12.000
Probably similar kind.

01:09:13.253 --> 01:09:14.388
Right?

01:09:14.621 --> 01:09:20.494
The funny thing is,
his name is also Wolly.

01:09:27.234 --> 01:09:28.702
“LOOKING FOR WOLLY”
We gotta take them back.

01:09:28.702 --> 01:09:29.736
Why?

01:09:30.804 --> 01:09:35.242
3-finger man saw it.
We could get caught!

01:09:35.776 --> 01:09:39.179
It’s all over town,
how do we get them all?

01:09:41.515 --> 01:09:44.484
Yes, right away.

01:09:47.054 --> 01:09:47.754
Whoa!

01:09:49.056 --> 01:09:50.257
Dammit!

01:09:51.024 --> 01:09:52.759
I knew this’d happen!

01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:12.112
LOOKING FOR WOLLY
REWARD: $500

01:10:16.116 --> 01:10:17.384
Do you know this man?

01:10:21.622 --> 01:10:24.892
He manages our assets,
something wrong?

01:10:25.626 --> 01:10:27.861
We’re after him
on a fraud charge.

01:10:28.128 --> 01:10:35.135
Fraud?
We noticed that you sold this land
and property for redevelopment.

01:10:35.736 --> 01:10:37.304
Sold this property?

01:10:38.505 --> 01:10:39.740
Marcel?

01:10:39.907 --> 01:10:45.012
You didn’t know?
He took off immediately
with the money.

01:10:45.245 --> 01:10:46.613
It was on the news.

01:10:48.916 --> 01:10:50.417
A huge sum.

01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:01.995
Like the job?

01:11:02.429 --> 01:11:03.664
Sure.

01:11:05.499 --> 01:11:08.735
I’ve never made lunch
for my kids.

01:11:09.303 --> 01:11:12.306
Feels weird to do it
for others.

01:11:34.361 --> 01:11:37.297
Yes, over here,
this way please.

01:12:19.006 --> 01:12:20.641
I don’t believe it.

01:12:50.737 --> 01:12:52.172
What is it?

01:12:52.239 --> 01:12:55.375
Why are there
red stickers all over?

01:12:55.609 --> 01:12:57.044
It’s nothing.

01:12:57.411 --> 01:12:58.745
You lie.

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:02.015
- What?
- You lied to me.

01:13:02.516 --> 01:13:03.617
What do you mean?

01:13:03.984 --> 01:13:06.887
You’ll be kicked out of here.

01:13:07.254 --> 01:13:12.359
I know, those stickers mean
you’ll be kicked out.

01:13:12.793 --> 01:13:16.663
They toss blankets
and stuff to the hallway,

01:13:16.864 --> 01:13:20.000
they shove you around,
things break...

01:13:20.133 --> 01:13:23.036
I lost my comb that way.

01:13:25.038 --> 01:13:28.041
Mom said that
it was no big deal too.

01:13:28.242 --> 01:13:32.379
You can’t get kicked out.
You shouldn’t live
in a car.

01:13:32.679 --> 01:13:37.784
You don’t know how sad it is
to be homeless and live in a car.

01:13:42.756 --> 01:13:44.124
What’s your name?

01:13:44.758 --> 01:13:47.494
- I’m Ji-so.
- Ji-so...

01:13:47.995 --> 01:13:49.530
It’s a pretty name.

01:13:53.734 --> 01:13:57.638
Do you know
how much this is worth?

01:13:57.671 --> 01:14:01.508
- How much?
- $250,000.

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:09.116
The painter died in an accident
when he was only 30.

01:14:09.116 --> 01:14:12.119
So there aren’t
many of his paintings.

01:14:12.419 --> 01:14:14.788
I’ve been collecting them.

01:14:15.889 --> 01:14:18.992
But I guess it’s time
to stop.

01:14:25.866 --> 01:14:28.635
YOON SU-OH

01:14:34.241 --> 01:14:35.742
YOON Su-oh?

01:14:37.511 --> 01:14:41.515
- Is he...
- He’s my son.

01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:48.789
He loved to paint,
he wanted to be a painter.
I said I’ll never allow it.

01:14:48.789 --> 01:14:54.494
So one day he left home.
Do you know what he said
before leaving?

01:14:54.494 --> 01:14:57.364
He said he hated me
more than anything.

01:14:57.998 --> 01:15:01.802
And he never once called me
until his death.
When I went to collect his body,

01:15:01.802 --> 01:15:06.740
When I went to collect his body,
a dog was guarding him.

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.009
Was that...

01:15:09.676 --> 01:15:11.111
Wolly?

01:15:22.055 --> 01:15:24.491
Please! Please!

01:15:29.997 --> 01:15:31.365
Dang it!

01:15:34.635 --> 01:15:37.237
I think we have to
sleep here tonight.

01:15:38.872 --> 01:15:40.374
Sleep here?

01:15:41.508 --> 01:15:43.243
What if someone sees us?

01:15:47.881 --> 01:15:50.384
I know this is hard,
but be patient, okay?

01:15:50.751 --> 01:15:53.053
Always ‘patient’.
Another week?!

01:15:54.288 --> 01:15:57.925
Watch your mouth,
who am I doing this for?

01:15:57.925 --> 01:16:00.494
Is this for me?
It’s for yourself!

01:16:00.928 --> 01:16:02.629
What did you just say?

01:16:04.264 --> 01:16:07.234
You told dad that
you were sick of him!

01:16:07.501 --> 01:16:09.736
Isn’t that why
he left home?

01:16:12.906 --> 01:16:16.743
Always like this,
you’re never considerate!

01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:20.113
Stubborn, always complaining,
and cranky!

01:16:20.113 --> 01:16:23.283
- When will you grow up?!
- Look who’s talking!

01:16:23.283 --> 01:16:26.787
- How could you
raise us here?!
- Hey! You brat!

01:16:31.391 --> 01:16:32.759
Dang it...

01:16:35.529 --> 01:16:40.234
If you left instead,
it wouldn’t be this bad.

01:16:56.984 --> 01:16:58.552
It’s really late...

01:17:01.989 --> 01:17:04.625
Why are you here?
Shouldn’t you be asleep?

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:07.761
She and mom fought.

01:17:07.794 --> 01:17:08.795
Hey!

01:17:09.997 --> 01:17:11.164
It’s nothing.

01:17:19.239 --> 01:17:23.777
Your mom haven’t
found a house yet?

01:17:25.546 --> 01:17:29.750
Not yet.
But she’s trying.

01:17:34.988 --> 01:17:37.257
Why do you live
like this?

01:17:41.295 --> 01:17:43.297
What’s wrong with
how I live?

01:17:44.765 --> 01:17:47.234
No house, and no money.

01:17:49.903 --> 01:17:53.140
Wanna see something cool?

01:17:56.877 --> 01:18:00.414
Ever heard of Myanmar?

01:18:01.381 --> 01:18:02.749
I have.

01:18:02.916 --> 01:18:07.754
There is a tribe called Moken.

01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:15.128
They’re born on a boat,
and live on it until they die.

01:18:15.863 --> 01:18:24.371
They don’t have apartments, fridges, or cars,
they just go where the ocean takes them.

01:18:24.505 --> 01:18:26.240
I live my life like that.

01:18:28.509 --> 01:18:31.278
If you had a kid my age,
you couldn’t, right?

01:18:31.278 --> 01:18:34.248
My daughter really loved that.

01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:41.488
So why have you lived like this?
Don’t you miss her?

01:18:41.488 --> 01:18:43.891
I miss her so much.

01:18:45.125 --> 01:18:47.261
Like you can’t even imagine.

01:18:47.995 --> 01:18:50.430
Then you can just go
see her.

01:18:52.366 --> 01:18:55.002
It’s shame,
I’m really ashamed.

01:18:55.369 --> 01:18:57.237
Ashamed of what?

01:19:02.042 --> 01:19:05.379
I was never good to her.

01:19:06.513 --> 01:19:13.987
When I really want to see her,
I watch her from afar.

01:19:20.494 --> 01:19:23.130
Would my dad do that too?

01:19:23.297 --> 01:19:27.501
Sure, all dads are the same.

01:19:42.783 --> 01:19:48.622
I bet Wolly wants to go home,
like we do.

01:19:49.156 --> 01:19:50.257
I know.

01:19:50.490 --> 01:19:55.629
I feel bad for Wolly,
like us.

01:19:55.996 --> 01:19:57.130
I know!

01:19:57.264 --> 01:19:59.900
What’s wrong with you?
Don’t rub it in!

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:06.373
Wolly became like that
because of us.

01:20:08.509 --> 01:20:11.778
Wouldn’t mom worry about us?

01:20:12.746 --> 01:20:17.618
We’re heading back,
what’s wrong with you today?

01:20:21.889 --> 01:20:25.492
If we sell all the artworks
I own,

01:20:27.294 --> 01:20:29.429
we can at least save Marcel.

01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:34.168
WILL: MARCEL GOES TO
MY NEPHEW JUNG SU-YOUNG.

01:20:35.002 --> 01:20:38.305
Take over Marcel from tomorrow.

01:20:38.739 --> 01:20:40.007
What about you, madam?

01:20:53.153 --> 01:20:54.621
As you wish, madam!

01:21:15.509 --> 01:21:16.610
Hello?

01:21:17.177 --> 01:21:20.781
Will you really pay
$500 for Wolly?

01:21:21.281 --> 01:21:23.483
Yes, why?

01:21:24.751 --> 01:21:26.987
I know where he is.

01:21:42.803 --> 01:21:46.373
Sis, mom’s gone.

01:21:49.276 --> 01:21:52.513
- She’s probably around.
- Mom!

01:21:53.113 --> 01:21:58.652
- Mom! Mom!
- Be quiet!

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:02.990
- Mom!
- You'll wake everyone up!

01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:08.362
- What if she left us like dad?
- Hey!

01:22:08.362 --> 01:22:14.368
- Mom left us because of you!
- Shut up!

01:22:14.735 --> 01:22:19.239
Mom! Where are you?

01:22:19.373 --> 01:22:22.376
Mom! Mom!

01:22:50.637 --> 01:22:52.306
I'LL MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT.

01:22:52.372 --> 01:22:55.242
I'M SORRY I WASN'T
A GOOD FATHER AND HUSBAND.

01:22:55.375 --> 01:22:57.744
PLEASE WAIT
JUST ONE WEEK.

01:23:03.016 --> 01:23:06.153
Be quiet! Stop that!

01:23:12.759 --> 01:23:13.994
Mom...

01:23:15.629 --> 01:23:21.134
Who said you could go out
at this hour!
How could you!

01:23:22.369 --> 01:23:23.737
Come here!

01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:28.275
You little brat!

01:23:28.509 --> 01:23:31.512
Why are you so bad?
You uncontrollable!

01:23:31.879 --> 01:23:34.882
What will I do,
if you leave like that!

01:23:35.282 --> 01:23:39.887
I can’t go on
without you.

01:23:41.655 --> 01:23:46.426
Without you,
I’ll die...

01:23:48.762 --> 01:23:53.000
Sorry, mom.
It’s my fault.

01:23:54.168 --> 01:23:55.402
I’m sorry.

01:23:56.303 --> 01:24:00.741
I’m sorry for raising you
in the van.

01:24:03.744 --> 01:24:10.284
Are we really living on here
because of my school?

01:24:12.553 --> 01:24:18.992
It’s dad, right?
So that he can find us,
isn’t that it?

01:24:26.733 --> 01:24:28.869
I miss dad.

01:24:29.236 --> 01:24:35.108
I hope he returns soon,
and turn things back to normal.

01:24:35.509 --> 01:24:40.113
I do too, sweetie.
I miss dad too.

01:24:43.884 --> 01:24:45.385
Ji-suk, come here.

01:24:46.486 --> 01:24:48.155
I’m sorry.

01:24:51.124 --> 01:24:52.993
I stole a dog.

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:56.763
I don’t know if that was
the perfect plan or not.

01:25:01.001 --> 01:25:04.638
But turns out, there was
more than achieving a goal.

01:25:05.906 --> 01:25:08.909
Living in a $500 deposit house,

01:25:09.009 --> 01:25:12.746
or having my party there
as a goal,

01:25:12.746 --> 01:25:14.781
could be dreadful.

01:25:15.249 --> 01:25:18.752
GET REWARD MONEY

01:25:21.555 --> 01:25:25.759
- What?
- Even if I continue living in a van,
will you stay friends with me?

01:25:25.759 --> 01:25:29.263
- Yup! Of course!
- It’s fun playing with you.

01:25:29.363 --> 01:25:31.365
Skipping classes too!

01:25:32.132 --> 01:25:36.370
But my mom caught me...

01:25:37.905 --> 01:25:39.673
I don’t want a party.

01:25:40.007 --> 01:25:41.175
Really?

01:25:41.508 --> 01:25:45.512
Yeah, we’ll take him
to Marcel’s front door.

01:25:45.779 --> 01:25:49.183
As if he came back
for granny.

01:25:51.051 --> 01:25:53.053
That’s perfect!

01:25:53.153 --> 01:25:54.121
Let’s do it!

01:25:58.792 --> 01:26:02.362
- Oh my goddess!
- What happened?

01:26:02.362 --> 01:26:06.800
- Can’t you see?
- 3-finger man took off with Wolly.

01:26:07.501 --> 01:26:09.136
Wolly...

01:26:10.871 --> 01:26:14.141
Maybe he took him back
for the reward?

01:26:14.374 --> 01:26:17.544
Or what if...
he ate him?

01:26:18.512 --> 01:26:19.613
No!

01:26:26.253 --> 01:26:28.555
- You thief!-
Where’s Wolly?

01:26:28.889 --> 01:26:32.759
- I was out looking for him.
- Did you eat him already?

01:26:36.663 --> 01:26:38.131
No!

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.236
I didn’t eat him,
I didn’t do it!

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.909
How many wheels do
I have?

01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:50.010
Four.

01:26:50.010 --> 01:26:52.379
But there’s only
1 track here.

01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.615
Who could it be?

01:26:57.551 --> 01:26:58.752
Thank you so much.

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.622
Wolly, come here!

01:27:05.025 --> 01:27:05.859
Wait!

01:27:05.859 --> 01:27:08.762
- And my $500?
- You’ll get it, so sit tight.

01:27:14.635 --> 01:27:16.870
So we did him a favor.

01:27:17.171 --> 01:27:19.873
But what matters is that
Wolly’s going home.

01:27:20.874 --> 01:27:23.744
But his home is the other way.

01:27:33.887 --> 01:27:34.888
There! I see him!

01:27:38.492 --> 01:27:42.296
Hurry, go after!
Step on it!

01:27:42.496 --> 01:27:44.131
Is this top speed?

01:27:44.364 --> 01:27:47.167
Walking would be faster!

01:27:49.236 --> 01:27:51.872
Children! Hold on tight!

01:28:02.049 --> 01:28:03.250
Out of the way!

01:28:07.654 --> 01:28:09.122
I’m sorry!

01:28:24.137 --> 01:28:27.875
There’s still 16km left.
That’s right.

01:28:29.243 --> 01:28:30.277
What’s that?

01:28:38.986 --> 01:28:40.420
Motorcycle, pull over.

01:28:40.621 --> 01:28:43.790
Pull over right now!
Children!

01:28:44.258 --> 01:28:46.260
Cops want us to stop!

01:28:46.527 --> 01:28:48.362
Pull over!

01:28:48.929 --> 01:28:50.297
Stop!

01:28:54.535 --> 01:28:55.502
Why you!

01:29:02.242 --> 01:29:03.410
Dammit!

01:29:10.384 --> 01:29:12.386
Wolly, sit!

01:29:24.765 --> 01:29:25.532
Hey!

01:29:26.166 --> 01:29:27.034
Hey!

01:29:28.135 --> 01:29:29.236
You bastard!

01:29:37.244 --> 01:29:38.178
Wolly?

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:41.281
That mutt.

01:29:42.382 --> 01:29:43.984
When did you learn
to run so fast?

01:29:45.619 --> 01:29:47.554
Where is he?

01:29:51.859 --> 01:29:54.294
There, that car!
Over there!

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:03.237
How could you let kids
ride in the back!

01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:07.374
Your ID please.
Give me your ID!

01:30:07.508 --> 01:30:08.609
Your ID.

01:30:08.675 --> 01:30:10.878
Where you going?

01:30:11.612 --> 01:30:12.779
Hey, come here!

01:30:21.488 --> 01:30:22.990
It’ll be over soon.

01:30:23.123 --> 01:30:24.391
That’s good.

01:30:26.159 --> 01:30:27.628
It’s okay, it’s okay.

01:30:33.634 --> 01:30:36.370
- How dare you!
- What are you doing?

01:30:36.370 --> 01:30:39.139
I have to take him
back to granny!

01:30:39.139 --> 01:30:42.109
He’ll never return to Marcel!

01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:45.245
- Give him to me!
- Let him go!

01:30:47.047 --> 01:30:48.549
Wolly!

01:30:53.053 --> 01:30:55.422
Wolly, come here boy!

01:30:55.556 --> 01:30:57.758
- Come here!
- Give him back!

01:30:57.758 --> 01:31:00.494
- I got him!
- Here you are!

01:31:00.761 --> 01:31:02.863
I’ve looked everywhere
for you.

01:31:03.163 --> 01:31:06.500
He kidnapped our puppy.

01:31:06.733 --> 01:31:08.235
That’s a lie!

01:31:09.002 --> 01:31:13.540
What's with you?
Drunk in broad daylight?
You drunk drove?

01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:18.178
- Of course not.
- They took my dog!
- Why’d they steal a dog?
It’s my dog!

01:31:18.745 --> 01:31:20.380
Let’s go to the station.

01:31:21.014 --> 01:31:24.551
Stay put!
It’s my dog!

01:31:24.751 --> 01:31:26.486
No, it’s not!

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:30.390
- You’re under arrest.
- Up yours!

01:31:46.006 --> 01:31:48.008
Thank you, mister.

01:31:48.609 --> 01:31:50.043
Wow!

01:31:50.611 --> 01:31:52.412
Mom bought a house?

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.248
It’s nice.

01:31:59.253 --> 01:32:00.988
- Well...
- I’m off.

01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:04.391
Wait.

01:32:04.992 --> 01:32:06.627
Let me see here.

01:32:07.361 --> 01:32:08.662
I...

01:32:10.130 --> 01:32:12.633
found this on the ground.

01:32:14.134 --> 01:32:17.738
- This is...
- Bye!

01:32:19.306 --> 01:32:21.275
- Wait!
- What?

01:32:21.742 --> 01:32:27.548
Your daughter really misses you!
Like you can’t imagine.

01:32:49.303 --> 01:32:51.004
What do we do now?

01:32:54.541 --> 01:32:57.110
I’ll go in and drop him off.

01:32:57.377 --> 01:33:02.916
- I wanna go too, sis.
- No, it has to be done quietly.

01:33:03.617 --> 01:33:05.252
Good bye, Wolly.

01:33:05.752 --> 01:33:07.387
So long, Wolly.

01:33:07.754 --> 01:33:09.256
Bye bye!

01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:26.373
Wolly, I’m sorry.

01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:32.880
I only thought of myself.
You need a home, like I do.

01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:34.381
I’m sorry.

01:33:35.549 --> 01:33:37.751
Someone’s waiting for you.

01:33:37.751 --> 01:33:41.889
I hope the person
I’m waiting for returns soon.

01:33:41.989 --> 01:33:43.056
Bye.

01:33:47.261 --> 01:33:50.764
You little.
So blinded by money!

01:33:51.365 --> 01:33:53.400
Your mom asked you to
do it?

01:33:54.635 --> 01:33:55.669
Of course not.

01:33:56.503 --> 01:33:58.505
What will you do with $500?

01:33:58.906 --> 01:34:00.240
Buy a house.

01:34:00.374 --> 01:34:03.377
- Where in the world is a $500 house?
- There is!

01:34:03.377 --> 01:34:05.679
- In Per Square.
- What?

01:34:07.114 --> 01:34:08.015
Here.

01:34:14.888 --> 01:34:17.124
This is per square meter.

01:34:17.291 --> 01:34:19.359
Give him to me.

01:34:21.261 --> 01:34:22.262
Give it!

01:34:23.630 --> 01:34:24.865
Why you little!

01:34:26.366 --> 01:34:28.235
- No!
- Don’t move!

01:34:29.503 --> 01:34:31.171
- Don’t!
- Hold still!

01:34:31.171 --> 01:34:32.873
No!

01:34:34.241 --> 01:34:37.177
-I fed you and cared for you!
- Wait!

01:34:37.778 --> 01:34:39.880
What are you doing?

01:34:45.385 --> 01:34:47.654
Wolly!

01:34:50.490 --> 01:34:53.126
I asked you a question.

01:34:56.163 --> 01:35:01.301
- I actually saw 1st draft of the will.
- What 1st draft?

01:35:01.635 --> 01:35:04.905
You left the entire
inheritance to Wolly.

01:35:05.005 --> 01:35:07.140
I’m your only bloodline!

01:35:07.407 --> 01:35:10.511
I’m no better
than a mutt?

01:35:11.545 --> 01:35:13.180
You’re unbelievable!

01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:19.253
Are you here
because of my wealth?

01:35:25.759 --> 01:35:26.760
Out.

01:35:28.161 --> 01:35:30.000
Fine, I’ll leave!

01:35:30.130 --> 01:35:33.166
- I don’t need to be treated this way!
- Off you go.

01:35:36.303 --> 01:35:38.138
That idiot...

01:35:50.884 --> 01:35:52.886
Thank you for
finding him.

01:35:52.986 --> 01:35:56.256
You were right about
him not leaving.

01:35:56.557 --> 01:35:59.126
I’ll leave you now.

01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.995
Good bye.

01:36:15.542 --> 01:36:17.110
Were you lost?

01:36:23.016 --> 01:36:25.752
Went to see the world?

01:36:32.626 --> 01:36:38.432
He absolutely loves it
without the leash.

01:36:41.001 --> 01:36:42.536
How do you know that?

01:36:45.005 --> 01:36:46.039
Actually...

01:36:52.112 --> 01:36:56.116
Actually, I stole him.

01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:57.784
What?

01:36:58.886 --> 01:37:01.755
I stole Wolly.

01:37:18.238 --> 01:37:23.277
It was the most difficult task
of my life so far.

01:37:23.744 --> 01:37:27.614
I told granny everything.

01:37:28.515 --> 01:37:32.052
How dad left us one day,

01:37:32.152 --> 01:37:35.389
how we were kicked out
of our home,

01:37:35.489 --> 01:37:38.659
the $500 house in Per Square

01:37:38.992 --> 01:37:43.931
and even having
a birthday party there.
I told her everything.

01:37:48.635 --> 01:37:54.741
When you experience hardships,
you're forced to do bad things.

01:37:55.108 --> 01:37:59.513
Even so,
what you did is terrible.

01:38:01.782 --> 01:38:03.984
Ji-so, nothing will change that.

01:38:05.619 --> 01:38:07.387
I’m sorry...

01:38:22.236 --> 01:38:24.638
I’ll be on my way.

01:38:54.368 --> 01:38:55.536
Kiddo!

01:38:59.506 --> 01:39:04.545
Could you walk him tomorrow?

01:39:08.282 --> 01:39:11.118
I’ll give you ice cream
in exchange.

01:39:47.788 --> 01:39:50.757
Sis, use this to buy our home.

01:39:52.759 --> 01:39:55.762
$500

01:40:14.915 --> 01:40:17.618
BUT I SHOULD
NEVER STEAL A DOG.

01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:25.259
What is that?

01:40:25.359 --> 01:40:26.260
Open it.

01:40:27.361 --> 01:40:29.162
This is for Ji-so.

01:40:29.863 --> 01:40:33.367
And this is for Ji-suk.

01:40:35.802 --> 01:40:36.637
Wow!

01:40:42.376 --> 01:40:44.111
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

01:40:53.921 --> 01:40:58.258
I’d never forget your birthday.

01:40:58.525 --> 01:41:00.761
I love you, honey.

01:41:02.996 --> 01:41:04.264
So pretty.

01:41:05.766 --> 01:41:09.503
Oh yeah! I’m gonna make
my own pizza tomorrow.

01:41:09.736 --> 01:41:11.004
Should we have
a pizza party?

01:41:11.672 --> 01:41:17.377
Mom, it’d be fun to have
pizza lunch box, right?

01:41:17.377 --> 01:41:19.246
What a great idea!

01:41:27.754 --> 01:41:29.056
It stopped raining.

01:41:30.624 --> 01:41:34.995
Sweetie, gather the toiletries
with Ji-suk.

01:41:36.763 --> 01:41:37.764
Why?

01:41:38.131 --> 01:41:42.236
The van’s busted,
so we have to go to sauna today.

01:41:47.741 --> 01:41:51.512
What to do with this busted van?
Send it to junkyard?

01:41:51.879 --> 01:41:53.046
Junkyard?

01:41:54.515 --> 01:41:58.385
It won’t start,
and only dad can fix it.

01:42:04.491 --> 01:42:06.360
- Mom, try to start it.
- What?

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:08.262
Give it a try!

01:42:08.795 --> 01:42:13.000
Don’t kid around.
I’m not, just try it!

01:42:22.876 --> 01:42:23.744
Ji-so...

01:42:47.234 --> 01:42:50.671
- Should we still go to the sauna?
- Sure!

01:43:02.049 --> 01:43:06.987
Following Ji-suk’s idea,
mom made pizza lunch boxes,

01:43:07.254 --> 01:43:08.121
and it...

01:43:08.622 --> 01:43:10.424
became a big hit!

01:43:11.525 --> 01:43:14.628
- Here you go.
- Good luck to you!
Have a great meal!

01:43:14.761 --> 01:43:16.129
You forgot a fork.

01:43:16.363 --> 01:43:20.133
The man who took
granny’s money was caught.

01:43:21.034 --> 01:43:24.738
So she didn’t have to sell
her house and paintings.

01:43:25.506 --> 01:43:29.376
And she bought
her son’s final painting.

01:43:29.376 --> 01:43:31.879
TITLE: THE WOMAN I LOVE THE MOST

01:43:37.384 --> 01:43:40.621
Nothing about Marcel changed.

01:43:40.888 --> 01:43:42.556
Oh yeah, there is one!

01:43:42.756 --> 01:43:44.258
I want my $500!

01:43:47.427 --> 01:43:51.632
When I asked her about
making a flyer for dad,

01:43:51.798 --> 01:43:54.501
- “Whatever.”
- she said.

01:43:54.501 --> 01:43:55.869
All adults are the same.

01:43:55.869 --> 01:43:58.005
“LOOKING FOR DAD”
All adults are the same.

01:43:58.005 --> 01:44:00.741
“LOOKING FOR DAD”
Pride or whatever they call it.

01:44:00.807 --> 01:44:03.277
DON’T BE SORRY,
WE’RE DOING GREAT.

01:44:23.530 --> 01:44:25.499
I still dream sometimes.

01:44:29.803 --> 01:44:34.308
In it, I live on the ocean
like the Moken tribe.

01:44:34.875 --> 01:44:38.612
And sometimes
Aesop comes for a chat.

01:44:39.179 --> 01:44:41.748
He’d ask me if I’m okay.

01:44:42.282 --> 01:44:44.284
I told him I was fine.

01:44:44.418 --> 01:44:45.285
Then he said...

01:44:51.859 --> 01:44:52.759
Whatever!

01:45:23.790 --> 01:45:26.927

01:45:44.244 --> 01:45:45.245
It’s this one!

01:45:48.015 --> 01:45:49.550
Tada!

01:45:50.250 --> 01:45:51.752
Wow!

01:45:52.986 --> 01:45:56.623
I came earlier
and decorated by myself.

01:45:56.657 --> 01:45:57.658
You like it?

01:45:58.926 --> 01:46:01.862
There’s even a room for you two.
Here!

01:46:01.862 --> 01:46:03.764
It’s huge!

01:46:05.365 --> 01:46:06.733
Go on in.

01:46:12.673 --> 01:46:16.777
I got a call from
Hanshin Real Estate.

01:46:17.010 --> 01:46:23.016
A granny’s renting out her son’s place
with only $500 house deposit!

01:46:23.483 --> 01:46:26.153
I didn’t know you could
get a house that cheap.

01:46:26.553 --> 01:46:30.257
Isn’t that weird?
Exactly $500!

01:46:44.171 --> 01:46:47.774
Square window,
spinning tire,

01:46:47.774 --> 01:46:54.781
there’re many good things
about living in a van

01:46:54.781 --> 01:47:01.388
With a single press,
the window rolls down,

01:47:01.388 --> 01:47:05.659
ever so effortlessly

01:47:05.792 --> 01:47:13.901
But I prefer to
use my hand instead

01:47:16.503 --> 01:47:22.743
Breathing in the wind
through the window,

01:47:22.743 --> 01:47:27.247
and realized
what’s important

01:47:27.247 --> 01:47:31.151
The living room I ran around in,

01:47:31.151 --> 01:47:37.891
the cute bedI slept so comfortably in

01:47:37.891 --> 01:47:42.129
Watching TV with my family,

01:47:42.129 --> 01:47:46.400
and even falling asleep on my desk...
