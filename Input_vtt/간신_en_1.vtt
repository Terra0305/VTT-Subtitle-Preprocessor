00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:40.123
Based on the true events
In the recorded history of Korea

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:03.438
1505 A.D.
King Yeonsan-gun ordered 'Beauty Recruit Officers'

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:06.733
to bring him over 10,000 women
for his carnal desires,

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.070
which led to widespread anger among the populace.
- ANNALS OF THE JOSEON DYNASTY -

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:15.951
To understand how
a king ruined his nation,

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:19.663
hear my tale.

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:25.043
It is the 10th year of his rule.

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:28.714
On the night of Blood Moon,

00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:33.385
two men met the mother of
deposed Queen Yoon.

00:01:34.178 --> 00:01:42.186
Through them the king obtained

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:45.189
a blood stained woman's clothing.

00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:49.359
Is this really what
my mother was wearing

00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:53.447
when she was killed?

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:54.698
Your Highness!

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:59.453
The late king wanted to
keep this a secret,

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:02.456
so I desired to
take this to my grave...

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:04.249
So why bring it now?

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:09.129
An unknown party
hired an assassin to steal it!

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:11.465
By whom?

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.634
Half of the court tried to
dethrone the late Queen,

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:16.261
so we do not know
who's behind the plot.

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:19.556
It’s obviously a matter of disloyalty
to destroy her majesty’s last remains

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:24.478
But we could not ignore
where this may lead to.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.855
Who'd have thought,

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:35.781
a piece of clothing would
result in a blood bath.

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:40.160
Where did
the enraged king first visit?

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:43.914
He killed his father's
2 resentful concubines

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:46.250
with his bare hands,

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:49.086
and iron mace.

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:54.633
Their bodies were torn up
and scattered in the mountain.

00:02:56.677 --> 00:03:02.683
He also killed his grandmother
for slandering his mother,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.978
and those who spread
defaming rumors,

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.689
supporters of dethronement,

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.401
maids who transported the poison,

00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.611
they were all mercilessly killed

00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:20.617
by poison, decapitation,

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.996
and dismemberment into pieces.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.165
Traitors' tombstones were destroyed,

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.627
their remains dug up

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:34.089
and smashed to smithereens,

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:40.679
eventually ending up as
dust in the air.

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:49.688
Over 200 remains were
fed to the pigs.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.651
This killing spree
became known as

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.613
the Second Literati Purge.

00:03:58.614 --> 00:04:03.660
However, two men never stopped
laughing during the purge

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.372
Minister IM Soong-jae,

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.667
and his father IM Sa-hong.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.671
They were
the most treacherous men alive.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.134
What goes around
comes around,

00:04:19.635 --> 00:04:28.685
your bone dust
may fly in the wind one day...

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:33.899
THE TREACHEROUS

00:04:41.657 --> 00:04:44.618
Your Highness, we can't...

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:46.620
Don't move!
I'm almost done.

00:04:47.663 --> 00:04:51.625
This brush won't let go
once in my hand.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.627
Minister!

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.879
Yes, Highness.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.634
I believe all vicious weeds
have been uprooted.

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:06.890
Your resolve to eliminate them
has reached the heavens.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.019
It wasn't my resolve alone,
your efforts paid off.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.605
All done.

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:15.649
Come in!

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:26.702
Please sit.

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:33.625
It is quite a sight.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:37.880
I just love this silver knife.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.926
With the will of the taker against
the defender of chastity,

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:47.639
two innate desires in one...

00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:49.850
It is simply magnificent.

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.436
I am honored, Your Highness.

00:05:52.436 --> 00:05:57.274
I must reward you two
for your continuous sacrifices.

00:05:58.442 --> 00:06:00.444
Hope you like it.

00:06:02.446 --> 00:06:06.450
Your grief over the recent affairs

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.745
is clearly expressed.

00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:12.706
What say you?

00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:18.587
Vivid sensuality is enough
to arouse one's lust,

00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:24.134
but their false expression
prevent it from reaching grace.

00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:27.137
Then I must throw this out.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.723
There is a way to elevate it.

00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:32.809
IM

00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:37.439
IM Soong-jae

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:41.485
By claiming it as my own,
it'll not taint your reputation,

00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:47.449
and it is a masterpiece
considering my limited talent.

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.411
Bullshit!

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.417
You are something!

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:02.089
Did the king really
bestow you this?

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:04.925
Don't you see my name on it?

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:08.595
Now, whoever
mimics this pose the best,

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.974
will be awarded with
this golden toad.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.064
My Lord.

00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:23.068
We only have
one new addition today.

00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:28.115
Is she not the one?

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.826
If you give me that drawing,

00:07:31.577 --> 00:07:33.370
I'll show you something better.

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:34.580
What?

00:07:34.997 --> 00:07:39.209
I heard you check
all the new girls.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:44.339
Who could you be looking for?

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:49.011
I'm not sure, but you are
definitely not the one.

00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:56.602
I heard you're the king's
most trusted confidant.

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.437
However,

00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:02.482
tonight, you are my king.

00:08:04.276 --> 00:08:07.154
Then I shall show you
how a king jests.

00:08:09.573 --> 00:08:12.201
For every jar I empty,
take off an article.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.621
If I pass out
before you're naked,

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.584
in addition to the drawing,
I'll bring you into the palace.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:25.589
But if I win,
you'll walk the streets naked.

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.926
- Will you accept?
- Of course.

00:09:32.573 --> 00:09:34.575
Hurry up.

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:39.580
Good.

00:09:49.882 --> 00:09:51.925
That was the final drink.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:10:00.058
- My Lord...
- Get on with it!

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.103
My Lord!

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.066
Please spare me!

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:12.112
Spare you?
It was merely a jest!

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:15.073
I overstepped...

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:20.037
You sly devious whore!

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:23.582
- Strip all the way!
- What's going on?!

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:25.125
Stop this at once!

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:28.295
The king's gift is an heirloom!

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.630
You must be joking.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:34.301
That lewd drawing
as an heirloom?

00:10:34.635 --> 00:10:36.678
You ungrateful bastard!

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:37.721
How dare you!

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.851
Don't you know
I got you reinstated?

00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:47.397
Everyone out!
At once!

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:52.945
After these two men
shook up the country,

00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:57.991
streets were filled with criticisms.

00:10:58.367 --> 00:11:03.664
The king left official duties behind
for carnal desires,

00:11:03.664 --> 00:11:10.087
royal advices from
his ministers fell on deaf ears.

00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:16.468
He turned a city
into a hunting ground...

00:11:18.262 --> 00:11:23.267
The hunt for his populace
or animals has begun!

00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:32.693
As his tyranny peaked,
this nation faced a crisis.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:39.199
'We must call for an uprising,

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:42.828
that thrones a fair king
to replace the old!'

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:51.211
Today's hunt is
starting off with a bang.

00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.213
Let's go!

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:55.132
No need for tears.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.968
Your life will change
if he asks for you.

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:00.720
Giddyup!

00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:08.020
It's been a while since
us brothers went on a hunt.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:10.898
Indeed, Your Highness.

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:14.443
Have you walked the streets
under a disguise lately?

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:16.403
Well, yes.

00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:20.282
If I am preoccupied with
official duties,

00:12:20.282 --> 00:12:23.827
it is your duty to keep an ear
on the populace on my behalf.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:24.953
Yes.

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:32.294
Or are you holding
something back?

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.130
What do you mean?

00:12:46.475 --> 00:12:50.437
I am simply jesting!

00:12:51.897 --> 00:12:57.277
You Highness, how about
a friendly race?

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.905
Yes, that'd be fun!

00:12:59.905 --> 00:13:01.323
Minister PARK!

00:13:01.907 --> 00:13:02.908
Yes, Your Highness!

00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:07.955
So...

00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:10.958
What should we bet?

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:15.337
I have nothing worthy to bet,
Your Highness.

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:16.922
You have your life.

00:13:16.922 --> 00:13:19.633
Highness, you jest.

00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:21.134
Don't worry.

00:13:21.552 --> 00:13:25.931
Many will offer their necks
in your stead.

00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:32.938
How about we test
their loyalty to you?

00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:47.930
Your Highness!

00:14:57.356 --> 00:14:59.149
Get the royal physician!

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.235
Physician! Physician!

00:15:06.323 --> 00:15:11.954
I order you to exterminate storks
from our land at once.

00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:13.956
Do you understand?

00:15:13.956 --> 00:15:15.916
Yes, Your Highness!

00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:24.591
The king began to suffer from
apparitions and insomnia,

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:31.640
it was said that this was
due to heavy blood loss.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.061
It was unlike of Soong-jae
to miss this chance.

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:38.438
Your Highness.

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:41.400
How do you feel?

00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:46.321
What do you think
of the sun?

00:15:47.948 --> 00:15:52.911
It is brilliantly radiant,
and all encompassing...

00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:56.290
Just like Your Highness.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:03.255
Then, like the sun,
do I...

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:06.258
encompass all of Joseon?

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:12.973
If you grace women of Joseon
with your light,

00:16:12.973 --> 00:16:17.644
it will rid of their shadows
and cure Your Highness.

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:22.357
What nonsense,
when His Highness is ill.

00:16:23.609 --> 00:16:28.947
There is no shame in
pursuing carnal desires.

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:33.994
I'll bring you a millennium of
pleasures for one night!

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:44.963
My baby.

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:50.010
It is my duty to select
the girls for the king.

00:16:50.594 --> 00:16:55.014
I know my baby's taste
the best.

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:59.144
I will handpick the girls
for my baby's liking,

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:02.064
so why don't you allow me...

00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:04.816
I have plans,

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:10.197
so set your worries aside,
and help me sleep.

00:17:10.906 --> 00:17:11.949
What plans?

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:17.412
Your Highness,
Minister IM has arrived.

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:19.331
Let him in!

00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:30.843
Just in time,
I've been curious.

00:17:30.843 --> 00:17:33.136
Here is the list of
candidates.

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:38.350
They say your life flashes
before you when facing death.

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:42.354
Do you know what I saw
at that moment?

00:17:43.647 --> 00:17:47.568
I saw the look of those
who wished for my death.

00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:52.573
I cannot forget
the anticipation on their faces.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.870
They'll hide their teeth
and wait for their time.

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:01.415
If their teeth are hidden
behind their lips,

00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:05.377
why not sew them shut
for good?

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:13.594
I've been holding banquets
despite difficult circumstances,

00:18:14.553 --> 00:18:19.308
to seek those who could
bear me an heir.

00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:25.689
I realized I should have
searched farther.

00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:31.528
Ergo, I order a nationwide
beauty recruiting.

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:37.826
They'll be called 'comforters',
and live up to that name.

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:41.246
Therefore, Minister IM Soong-jae,

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:43.624
and Minister of Defense IM Sa-hong

00:18:44.208 --> 00:18:48.795
are given full royal authority
as 'Beauty Recruit Officers'!

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:54.551
We are eternally grateful,
Your Highness.

00:18:57.596 --> 00:19:00.224
It's a sunny place

00:19:00.224 --> 00:19:04.269
and a prime spot
to watch the sunset.

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:09.608
I was saving it for a gazebo,
but I hope you like it.

00:19:10.234 --> 00:19:13.570
It's good enough for a palace!

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.656
Palace? Nice!

00:19:19.618 --> 00:19:22.538
How would we solicit
to change king's orders?

00:19:23.247 --> 00:19:25.207
We cannot accept this.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.672
-Sir...
- Out of my way!

00:19:32.381 --> 00:19:33.423
Minister YU...

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:37.219
Consort JANG must be desperate.

00:19:38.095 --> 00:19:40.264
But you didn't
need to be so cold.

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:43.308
We cannot ignore her.

00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:49.648
Thought the candidates
were chosen at random?

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:59.950
Those who looked down on us
will beg for their lives.

00:20:00.951 --> 00:20:05.455
The strong gets to pick,
the weak gets picked.

00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:07.541
One more drink, please?

00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:10.294
- Come here, bitch!
- Minister PARK, it's not our room!

00:20:10.294 --> 00:20:15.299
I didn't realize the loyal subjects

00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:20.721
who work tirelessly
for the king's virility were here.

00:20:21.972 --> 00:20:23.932
Excuse me.

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:31.231
As if all your scheming
and pimping weren't enough,

00:20:31.982 --> 00:20:37.029
now you'll scrounge
every virgin for his pleasure?

00:20:37.571 --> 00:20:39.239
Drink quietly.

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:40.532
Soong-jae.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:43.869
Are you so desperate for power?

00:20:43.869 --> 00:20:47.873
Is it today?
Your sister's death anniversary.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.630
When the king frequented her room,
I was often by his side.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.467
What I heard weren't screams,
but moans.

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.219
So why the suicide?

00:21:00.219 --> 00:21:01.595
IM Soong-jae!

00:21:02.221 --> 00:21:03.305
How does it feel!

00:21:04.223 --> 00:21:07.976
To know that
you bow down to the man

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:11.230
who raped your sister?

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:16.568
May I have another?

00:21:28.247 --> 00:21:32.251
Are you confident that
you can serve the king?

00:21:32.543 --> 00:21:35.295
I have experienced
men of all kinds,

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:39.508
from nobles, farmers, butchers,
to even thugs.

00:21:39.508 --> 00:21:41.885
Any man with balls intact,

00:21:42.261 --> 00:21:44.429
I can wrap him in my skirt

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:46.682
and suck his soul out.

00:21:46.682 --> 00:21:50.227
How dare you compare
the king to peasants!

00:21:50.227 --> 00:21:52.229
But isn't the king

00:21:52.688 --> 00:21:54.565
also a man?

00:21:54.565 --> 00:21:58.569
Overconfidence aside,
you'll do.

00:21:59.528 --> 00:22:01.697
Glad that she's to your liking.

00:22:01.947 --> 00:22:05.868
I cannot tolerate
the two 'IM's anymore.

00:22:05.868 --> 00:22:08.412
I must regain my power,

00:22:08.412 --> 00:22:10.622
so take special care,
Minister YU!

00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:18.422
Red!

00:22:18.714 --> 00:22:21.300
It's red!

00:22:21.675 --> 00:22:25.762
One word out of the king,
the red flag is raised.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:32.186
Show yourself!
Show yourself to me!

00:22:32.728 --> 00:22:37.356
The one who'll comfort the king
will become Comforters!

00:22:37.941 --> 00:22:40.694
The one who'll cleanse him,

00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:43.697
will be the Consort!

00:22:44.907 --> 00:22:47.034
It's not a formal court affair.

00:22:47.659 --> 00:22:53.081
So it won't be guaranteed
whether the king will grace her.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:58.670
But ultimately she'll serve the king.

00:22:59.379 --> 00:23:00.464
Father!

00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:03.717
Let me go!

00:23:04.676 --> 00:23:05.677
Honey!

00:23:06.512 --> 00:23:12.684
Daughters, wives, mistresses
were all requisitioned...

00:23:13.644 --> 00:23:17.648
Wearing red uniform
and taking girls away,

00:23:17.648 --> 00:23:19.858
they were the grim reapers,

00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:24.738
and not a single woman
was spotted on the street.

00:23:25.697 --> 00:23:32.496
There are more than
one way to find girls!

00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:38.627
Oh no!

00:23:38.627 --> 00:23:40.212
Your Majesty!

00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:45.217
This young lady is destined to
become a queen!

00:23:45.217 --> 00:23:47.344
-  Please stop.
- Your Majesty!

00:23:49.096 --> 00:23:50.639
Dammit.

00:23:50.639 --> 00:23:52.683
- Come with us!
- Wait! Hold on!

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.651
So much chaos
and shady deals.

00:24:03.652 --> 00:24:07.698
One could not watch on
without tearing up.

00:24:08.156 --> 00:24:09.074
Virgin!

00:24:09.658 --> 00:24:14.663
Virgins were marked red,
while others blue.

00:24:15.664 --> 00:24:18.709
The royal artist painted
day and night,

00:24:18.709 --> 00:24:23.755
turning teary faces
into happy ones.

00:24:25.966 --> 00:24:29.928
I think we have enough.

00:24:30.679 --> 00:24:35.726
But the king will want someone
truly unique.

00:24:37.644 --> 00:24:40.731
They are not enough
to win against the Consort.

00:24:41.648 --> 00:24:42.733
If so...

00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:47.112
there's one last place to visit.

00:24:47.112 --> 00:24:49.698
NEUNGJU

00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:51.700
Enough!

00:24:58.665 --> 00:24:59.708
Listen here.

00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:05.255
Debt must be repaid with money,
what is this nonsense?

00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:10.802
You moved up the deadline,
this was all I could muster.

00:25:10.802 --> 00:25:16.517
So, didn't I say
I'll void your debt

00:25:16.517 --> 00:25:19.186
for a drink
with your daughter.

00:25:19.186 --> 00:25:21.647
Do you not understand?!

00:25:22.689 --> 00:25:27.110
I'll make her an orphan

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.695
and take her!

00:25:33.325 --> 00:25:35.661
Who's this?

00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:37.871
You haven't changed at all.

00:25:38.038 --> 00:25:40.874
Your sharp tongue is
still the same.

00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:43.085
Come in.

00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:44.670
Come.

00:25:45.045 --> 00:25:47.381
Father! Father!

00:25:47.673 --> 00:25:49.633
Are you all right?

00:25:54.555 --> 00:25:57.850
I heard you and my father
were old friends.

00:25:58.058 --> 00:26:00.102
We were indeed.

00:26:00.102 --> 00:26:04.898
Time travels faster
than an arrow.

00:26:05.065 --> 00:26:09.194
I also heard you promised
to achieve greatness together!

00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:11.446
Did we?

00:26:11.446 --> 00:26:16.285
Well, it became difficult
since my father was dismissed.

00:26:16.285 --> 00:26:22.416
You could've prevented
his dismissal.

00:26:22.791 --> 00:26:27.254
But instead,
you spoke ill of him!

00:26:29.423 --> 00:26:31.008
Checkmate.

00:26:31.008 --> 00:26:32.509
Bad move.

00:26:33.093 --> 00:26:35.053
Mind if I take back?

00:26:35.554 --> 00:26:36.597
Not at all!

00:26:38.015 --> 00:26:40.017
Not a problem at all.

00:26:43.604 --> 00:26:48.442
Look, I couldn't help him
back then,

00:26:48.442 --> 00:26:53.155
since I was too weak
to stand against the court.

00:26:53.155 --> 00:26:54.781
There was no malice.

00:26:55.115 --> 00:27:01.705
Please forgive me...
Take my fortune!

00:27:02.289 --> 00:27:09.922
Just look at her,
she's my only daughter!

00:27:14.927 --> 00:27:17.304
Minister, I have a lover!

00:27:17.304 --> 00:27:21.850
A palanquin will come for her,
so have her ready.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.441
Did you hear?
Even Lord JO got raided.

00:27:29.983 --> 00:27:33.904
Those scouts are
no better than pirates.

00:27:33.904 --> 00:27:36.907
They already took more than
ten thousand girls!

00:27:36.907 --> 00:27:38.367
It's insane!

00:27:38.909 --> 00:27:42.246
If I ever see
one of those scouts,

00:27:42.454 --> 00:27:45.415
I'll skin them alive!

00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:50.295
Why aren't I recruited?
I'm the fairest.

00:27:50.879 --> 00:27:54.633
Shit, your face provokes
violence in men.

00:27:54.633 --> 00:27:57.886
Say what?
You asshole!

00:27:58.887 --> 00:28:00.931
Leaving already?

00:28:00.931 --> 00:28:02.891
They'll begin soon.

00:28:02.891 --> 00:28:03.892
Begin what?

00:28:03.934 --> 00:28:07.020
Aren't you here for the show?

00:28:20.951 --> 00:28:25.956
The world is in disarray,
people are driven into mountains,

00:28:25.956 --> 00:28:30.878
and the hunger has forced them
to eat each other.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:37.926
The enraged mountain god
sent a tiger!

00:28:39.928 --> 00:28:43.932
With the god's order,
it came to renounce the world,

00:28:44.224 --> 00:28:48.937
but could not find any
guilty men.

00:28:48.937 --> 00:28:51.940
Why should people be guilty
of poverty?

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:56.904
Corrupt officials behind high walls
are the guilty ones.

00:28:56.904 --> 00:28:58.614
They deserve to die!

00:28:58.614 --> 00:29:03.285
When the tiger could not
climb over the high wall,

00:29:03.911 --> 00:29:08.957
it decided to become flesh
and blood of the peasants,

00:29:08.957 --> 00:29:17.341
and help wreak havoc
on the corrupted.

00:29:21.929 --> 00:29:23.972
He saw her briefly.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.560
Wide forehead,
eyebrows like weeping willow,

00:29:28.936 --> 00:29:33.524
clear peacock eyes,
sharp nose,

00:29:33.941 --> 00:29:36.985
and lips like peach skin...

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.324
He knew he had found the one!

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.994
But... she was a meager butcher.

00:29:45.994 --> 00:29:48.247
A butcher!

00:30:45.888 --> 00:30:46.930
Look here!

00:30:48.557 --> 00:30:50.058
May I help you?

00:30:50.058 --> 00:30:51.643
Could you remove your hat?

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.104
It's no face for a noble.

00:30:54.104 --> 00:30:55.105
Hey! It's him.

00:30:55.981 --> 00:30:58.358
Fitting your title
as the women hunter!

00:30:58.358 --> 00:31:01.987
Going after a girl
like a dog in heat!

00:31:01.987 --> 00:31:04.281
How dare you
talk to a noble like that!

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.534
I got no business
with you two, so get lost.

00:31:07.951 --> 00:31:08.994
Let's go.

00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:15.751
Who hired you?

00:31:16.001 --> 00:31:17.002
Hire me?

00:31:17.002 --> 00:31:18.295
You got it wrong.

00:31:18.295 --> 00:31:21.548
I volunteer myself
to kick the shit out of you!

00:31:21.548 --> 00:31:22.633
- Agree?
- Sure.

00:31:36.021 --> 00:31:38.982
I got him good!

00:31:50.327 --> 00:31:51.286
You bitch!

00:31:52.996 --> 00:31:53.997
You bastard!

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.982
Feeling better, sir?

00:32:20.566 --> 00:32:21.567
Are you hurt?

00:32:21.984 --> 00:32:23.026
It's nothing.

00:32:23.652 --> 00:32:26.989
Why did you follow me?

00:32:29.366 --> 00:32:33.412
I once knew a sword dancer.

00:32:33.954 --> 00:32:38.458
She had a unique
hand gesture and steps.

00:32:39.376 --> 00:32:42.212
Where did you learn
that dance?

00:32:42.963 --> 00:32:46.800
It came to me
while working as a butcher.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.011
Not from a teacher.

00:32:51.263 --> 00:32:52.264
I see.

00:32:54.683 --> 00:32:57.978
Sir, I have a favor to ask.

00:32:57.978 --> 00:32:59.062
Could you...

00:32:59.062 --> 00:33:01.190
recruit me?

00:33:04.985 --> 00:33:06.403
I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.

00:33:06.403 --> 00:33:09.990
Is it because my hands reek
of animal blood?

00:33:10.365 --> 00:33:11.408
At least you know.

00:33:11.408 --> 00:33:12.451
But sir!

00:33:13.202 --> 00:33:16.246
My father has a large debt.

00:33:16.246 --> 00:33:17.206
So please...

00:33:17.206 --> 00:33:18.207
Let go.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.212
I will even...

00:33:23.212 --> 00:33:25.255
offer myself to you.

00:33:33.931 --> 00:33:36.183
Come on out!

00:33:54.952 --> 00:33:56.828
Show your face!

00:34:00.249 --> 00:34:03.418
I am Jung-hwa,
Lord JO's daughter.

00:34:38.203 --> 00:34:39.204
I'm back, father.

00:34:39.204 --> 00:34:41.039
Good work.

00:34:49.214 --> 00:34:51.175
- Let's go inside.
- Yes.

00:34:57.222 --> 00:34:58.265
Over there!

00:34:59.183 --> 00:35:00.225
What are you doing?!

00:35:13.238 --> 00:35:17.242
Nothing wrong with
getting a little taste.

00:35:17.242 --> 00:35:19.828
Hold still!

00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:26.919
Do you wish to die?

00:35:27.169 --> 00:35:29.254
She's a property of the king.

00:35:30.172 --> 00:35:31.757
Spare me, sir!

00:35:31.757 --> 00:35:33.467
Your father allowed it...

00:35:33.467 --> 00:35:36.428
- You lie!
- It's true.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.224
Was this your plan
all along?

00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:46.188
She'll be defiled at the palace,
it won't make a difference.

00:35:47.231 --> 00:35:50.234
She's just paying for
her father's crimes.

00:35:51.193 --> 00:35:55.239
Will you give up your power
over petty grudge?

00:35:56.198 --> 00:35:59.243
Makhana lotus flower
blooms once a century.

00:35:59.868 --> 00:36:02.579
She is the lotus I found!

00:36:02.579 --> 00:36:06.875
It's too early to know
if she'll bloom or wither.

00:36:08.919 --> 00:36:13.507
The path towards the king
won't be so smooth.

00:36:13.507 --> 00:36:15.425
I was just startled.

00:36:15.425 --> 00:36:20.222
A lowly butcher personating
a noble's daughter...

00:36:21.723 --> 00:36:23.767
What are you really after?

00:36:24.226 --> 00:36:29.231
Repaying my father's debt,
that's all.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:35.112
You chose to walk this path,
let's see how long you last.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.663
Your Highness!

00:36:44.663 --> 00:36:48.166
- Minister PARK reporting...
- Who dares to interrupt!

00:37:02.181 --> 00:37:04.183
- Are they here?
- Yes, Your Highness.

00:37:22.868 --> 00:37:25.204
Minister IM Sa-hong.

00:37:25.204 --> 00:37:27.206
Minister IM Soong-jae.

00:37:28.457 --> 00:37:31.835
We returned from our duties...

00:37:34.087 --> 00:37:35.214
Okay! Good!

00:37:35.547 --> 00:37:37.174
I've waited so long!

00:37:37.174 --> 00:37:40.177
Good, raise your heads!

00:37:40.177 --> 00:37:41.220
Now!

00:37:41.845 --> 00:37:44.890
You'll eat Joseon's
greatest delicacies

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.684
on gold plates
to your heart's content.

00:37:48.185 --> 00:37:52.356
You'll wear clothes of
silk and satin,

00:37:52.731 --> 00:37:58.529
we'll hold banquets on the river,
bathe in the valley,

00:37:58.529 --> 00:38:03.784
hunt tigers together,
and make love every day...

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:08.286
However, if you miss
your husband or lover,

00:38:08.205 --> 00:38:10.457
or even think about escaping,

00:38:10.457 --> 00:38:13.043
I'll behead you on the spot!

00:38:18.715 --> 00:38:24.680
All right! I'll take you
to our playground!

00:38:26.515 --> 00:38:27.808
Behold!

00:38:32.896 --> 00:38:36.900
Let me introduce your peers!

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.320
This university is intended
to educate...

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:46.910
Even Confucius said
if you disregard interaction,

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:52.291
you can't expect
true growth, right?

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:58.338
There are strict code of conduct
between men and women.

00:38:58.338 --> 00:39:01.383
I even brought your wife here.

00:39:01.884 --> 00:39:03.510
So don't be so harsh.

00:39:04.595 --> 00:39:07.389
How's our baby?

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:11.894
I found a wet nurse,
so don't worry.

00:39:16.899 --> 00:39:20.358
Until these comforters
become consorts,

00:39:20.277 --> 00:39:22.738
they'll reside here,

00:39:22.738 --> 00:39:27.534
and lower comforters will be
disciplined at nearby temples!

00:39:28.118 --> 00:39:29.912
Yes, Your Highness!

00:39:33.624 --> 00:39:36.835
This is unbearable.

00:39:36.835 --> 00:39:42.257
Turning universities and temples
into comforter training camps!

00:39:42.508 --> 00:39:45.886
This has gone too far
and too long.

00:39:46.428 --> 00:39:48.889
How long must we wait?

00:39:49.681 --> 00:39:52.893
Who must we induct?

00:39:52.893 --> 00:39:57.898
Who else?
Prince Jinseong, of course.

00:40:00.901 --> 00:40:02.945
Our time will come.

00:40:04.321 --> 00:40:07.115
People's resentment is
getting deeper.

00:40:11.912 --> 00:40:13.872
Wake up!

00:40:14.831 --> 00:40:17.918
Move faster!
Hurry!

00:40:17.918 --> 00:40:20.879
What makes an ideal woman?

00:40:20.879 --> 00:40:24.883
Large mouth and clean teeth
that can envelop a manhood,

00:40:24.883 --> 00:40:28.512
long black hair like silk
and slender ankles.

00:40:29.596 --> 00:40:33.934
Satin-like skin
and warm body temperature.

00:40:33.934 --> 00:40:38.897
Full buttocks and thin bones!

00:40:40.899 --> 00:40:44.862
And what makes
a desirable vagina?

00:40:45.529 --> 00:40:48.907
First, the opening should be
near the front.

00:40:48.907 --> 00:40:54.413
Second, less pubic hair is best,
and must be thin and fair.

00:40:54.621 --> 00:40:59.042
Third, it must always be
warm and moist.

00:41:00.544 --> 00:41:03.922
When it comes to size,
it should be

00:41:04.464 --> 00:41:09.094
just big enough
to fit the king's manhood.

00:41:10.429 --> 00:41:14.892
Sex positions all have
one principle

00:41:14.892 --> 00:41:18.896
to achieve pure bliss
through proper contact.

00:41:18.896 --> 00:41:22.524
How do you consider yourself
for the ultimate contact?

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.902
- Confucius said...
- With respect...

00:41:24.902 --> 00:41:29.406
Aren't we just wet holes
for the king to fuck?

00:41:30.908 --> 00:41:34.912
We're royal palace piss pots,
albeit the best kind.

00:41:35.579 --> 00:41:41.418
Capable of taking any loads
from men of all ages and sorts.

00:41:44.213 --> 00:41:45.714
We are like medicine.

00:41:45.964 --> 00:41:49.885
Using our body to heal another.

00:41:50.636 --> 00:41:52.346
That is the real contact.

00:41:53.889 --> 00:41:56.141
Very good!

00:41:56.475 --> 00:42:01.855
Whatever it may be,
nobody knows who among you

00:42:01.855 --> 00:42:04.858
will become consorts
or discarded as slaves.

00:42:04.858 --> 00:42:06.944
Contests and lectures will be held,

00:42:06.944 --> 00:42:09.905
so do your absolute best.

00:42:11.907 --> 00:42:14.368
Do you really believe
you're a medicine?

00:42:15.911 --> 00:42:18.705
I shall teach you
how to be one.

00:42:20.874 --> 00:42:23.877
How ridiculous,
how ridiculous...

00:42:23.877 --> 00:42:29.299
The king is a poet,
so learn the metaphors.

00:42:29.883 --> 00:42:31.927
He is a brilliant painter!

00:42:31.927 --> 00:42:35.889
Use your body
to express yourself.

00:42:37.891 --> 00:42:40.978
Pierce the moon with your toes!

00:42:41.186 --> 00:42:42.145
Higher!

00:42:42.896 --> 00:42:47.609
Raising your heels will develop
your pelvic muscles.

00:42:49.194 --> 00:42:51.905
Cleaning with unbent knees
stimulates the uterus,

00:42:51.905 --> 00:42:53.657
and tenderizes your inside.

00:42:54.658 --> 00:42:57.744
Mix sulfur, gemmifera roots,
cornus fruit, and cnidium,

00:42:57.744 --> 00:42:59.913
grind and sift them,
then insert it.

00:43:00.873 --> 00:43:04.251
It'll shrink your vagina
and make it more sensitive.

00:43:06.879 --> 00:43:12.509
Mix 3 spoons of sulfur in water
and wash your privates.

00:43:12.885 --> 00:43:15.846
It'll make it
like a young girl's.

00:43:15.846 --> 00:43:16.930
Who's there?

00:43:20.893 --> 00:43:22.895
Do not flinch!

00:43:22.895 --> 00:43:25.939
Feminine energy stems from
lower abdomen.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:34.198
After sensual Taoist trainings,

00:43:34.198 --> 00:43:36.909
only two remained!

00:43:37.534 --> 00:43:41.580
A butcher who hid her true self,

00:43:41.872 --> 00:43:45.459
and a concubine who was
filled with deep jealousy.

00:43:46.919 --> 00:43:52.883
Squeeze out the seeds
and don't spill a single drop.

00:44:00.891 --> 00:44:05.229
Testicles are sensitive,
only use tongue to stimulate.

00:44:19.701 --> 00:44:23.121
There are 6 intercourse guidelines.

00:44:23.455 --> 00:44:24.873
One.

00:44:24.873 --> 00:44:28.877
Like a wet cloth,
embrace him tightly.

00:44:29.253 --> 00:44:31.880
Two, uterus must be warm.

00:44:32.714 --> 00:44:36.093
Otherwise, there'll be
vaginal discharge.

00:44:37.845 --> 00:44:38.887
Three.

00:44:39.847 --> 00:44:45.853
Upon insertion,
tighten your vaginal walls

00:44:46.895 --> 00:44:48.856
Four.

00:44:49.857 --> 00:44:53.443
When on top,
gyrate your hips.

00:44:53.861 --> 00:44:55.153
Five.

00:44:55.153 --> 00:44:59.366
Moan seductively under him.

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:02.035
Six.

00:45:03.328 --> 00:45:06.915
When you don't reach orgasm,
he may work too hard for it.

00:45:08.959 --> 00:45:12.880
If he ejaculates too early,
it could only mean trouble.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.548
- So you must climax hastily.
- It's all right.

00:45:14.548 --> 00:45:15.924
It's not all right!

00:45:16.675 --> 00:45:18.927
Do not forget these guidelines!

00:45:31.857 --> 00:45:36.361
With everyone in one place,

00:45:36.862 --> 00:45:39.531
it's like addressing
the entire nation.

00:45:39.531 --> 00:45:42.534
We're not worthy,
Your Highness.

00:45:42.868 --> 00:45:46.371
Pick a dish
and introduce yourself.

00:45:52.294 --> 00:45:56.298
I'm from deep valleys
of Milyang.

00:45:56.298 --> 00:46:00.511
Your southern accent will
charm us all!

00:46:00.886 --> 00:46:02.012
You're the Cutie.

00:46:02.846 --> 00:46:03.931
I am...

00:46:05.849 --> 00:46:08.852
Look at her!

00:46:08.852 --> 00:46:11.021
I'll call you the Wimp.

00:46:11.855 --> 00:46:14.900
The Elegant, the Beautiful,
the Skilled...

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.529
The king inspected
everyone very carefully,

00:46:18.529 --> 00:46:21.865
but soon got bored of it,

00:46:21.865 --> 00:46:25.244
and didn't even bother anymore.

00:46:29.456 --> 00:46:31.124
That's her.

00:46:43.095 --> 00:46:47.933
They say, a horse's penis
even gave Buddha an erection.

00:46:57.359 --> 00:47:00.571
I am Seol,
a Kaesong concubine.

00:47:03.365 --> 00:47:08.370
With one glimpse,
I can tell you are special.

00:47:16.378 --> 00:47:18.255
You are the Bewitcher.

00:47:22.676 --> 00:47:24.386
Best of the bunch!

00:47:26.346 --> 00:47:29.349
I'll see you
in the palace soon.

00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:31.310
Yes, Your Highness.

00:47:33.353 --> 00:47:36.315
Anyone else?

00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:48.327
That's inedible!

00:47:57.252 --> 00:47:58.378
Stand up.

00:47:59.963 --> 00:48:02.049
Where was this jewel found?

00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:05.844
I'm Jung-hwa,
Neungju Lord JO's daughter.

00:48:06.386 --> 00:48:08.055
Do you know
what you just ate?

00:48:08.972 --> 00:48:13.477
It is heifer's uterus,
preserved with garlic,

00:48:14.061 --> 00:48:15.979
a placenta dish.

00:48:15.979 --> 00:48:18.982
It's my favorite dish.

00:48:19.983 --> 00:48:22.027
How did it taste?

00:48:22.027 --> 00:48:23.987
It was sorrowful.

00:48:25.989 --> 00:48:27.032
Sorrowful?

00:48:28.992 --> 00:48:33.163
Teardrops on a pillow,
raindrops on a step stone,

00:48:33.997 --> 00:48:38.961
over the window,
rain falls all night,

00:48:40.003 --> 00:48:44.007
and a mother's jacket...

00:48:48.428 --> 00:48:50.639
turns crimson.

00:49:02.484 --> 00:49:06.071
A true diamond
in the rough.

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:11.785
You are... the Master.

00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:14.997
I am honored, Your Highness.

00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:18.292
- Minister IM!
- Yes, Your Highness!

00:49:18.292 --> 00:49:20.961
I want her in the palace
right now!

00:49:20.961 --> 00:49:22.671
- But it is not...
- Your Highness.

00:49:22.671 --> 00:49:26.967
Good things come to
those who wait.

00:49:26.967 --> 00:49:29.970
You should observe
until she's ripe.

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:31.138
Observe?!

00:49:34.975 --> 00:49:37.978
If you so insist.

00:49:39.396 --> 00:49:44.860
The fact is, I feel so empty
and lonely.

00:49:46.528 --> 00:49:50.449
Please rush the training.

00:49:50.824 --> 00:49:52.743
Yes, Your Highness!

00:49:53.994 --> 00:49:56.371
I never anticipated
this contest,

00:49:56.371 --> 00:49:58.457
but of all the girls,
why her?

00:49:59.166 --> 00:50:02.544
You see,
it's unfolding as I've told you.

00:50:02.544 --> 00:50:03.545
Nonsense!

00:50:04.379 --> 00:50:09.006
When I think of my life in exile,
while her father...

00:50:09.259 --> 00:50:13.764
Do you think I'd hand over
such power to them?

00:50:18.977 --> 00:50:23.524
Lord JO's daughter?
What a treacherous pair!

00:50:24.274 --> 00:50:28.987
How could the IMs support
a daughter of their nemesis?

00:50:33.992 --> 00:50:37.996
But I can see why
he would support her.

00:50:39.957 --> 00:50:44.002
Yes, there's something
special about her,

00:50:44.002 --> 00:50:47.339
even her scent is...

00:50:47.339 --> 00:50:48.757
Enough!

00:50:49.341 --> 00:50:52.010
Minister YU!

00:50:53.178 --> 00:50:55.013
Get it together!

00:50:55.013 --> 00:50:56.557
My apologies!

00:50:56.557 --> 00:51:00.936
From Neungju, right?
Find out more about her.

00:51:00.936 --> 00:51:02.563
- Certainly.
- Right now!

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.983
You better up your game!

00:51:12.656 --> 00:51:16.034
Looks like the butchering
gave you the edge.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.830
But for an uneducated
peasant,

00:51:20.622 --> 00:51:23.000
how did you come up
with such a poem?

00:51:23.375 --> 00:51:26.003
Even a lowly girl has
good taste buds,

00:51:26.712 --> 00:51:30.048
I just tried to mimic
what I learned.

00:51:30.883 --> 00:51:32.009
Begin.

00:51:47.983 --> 00:51:50.027
As if in a dream,

00:51:50.736 --> 00:51:54.990
a wave of realization
came over him.

00:52:23.894 --> 00:52:31.026
Her delicate hand gesture
startled his pupils,

00:52:31.026 --> 00:52:41.161
and melted
his frozen memories.

00:52:59.596 --> 00:53:03.016
Can a father's crimes
be inherited?

00:53:03.976 --> 00:53:13.277
She was traitor Lord KIM Il-son's
daughter Dan-hee.

00:53:37.759 --> 00:53:41.346
Your transfixion left you
ignorant to my presence.

00:53:42.055 --> 00:53:43.348
My apologies, Your Highness.

00:53:55.569 --> 00:53:57.613
As with last time,

00:53:57.613 --> 00:54:01.366
you bring me many delights.

00:54:01.992 --> 00:54:04.119
I'm not worthy,
Your Highness.

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:12.878
I'll soon open a banquet
to test your training.

00:54:12.878 --> 00:54:16.840
The winner will not only
become my consort,

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.884
she'll receive
a large sum of gold...

00:54:18.884 --> 00:54:20.511
When I am in the palace,

00:54:20.511 --> 00:54:24.806
even a million gold coins
hold no value.

00:54:32.189 --> 00:54:35.609
Then what'd
make you happy?

00:54:37.361 --> 00:54:42.407
This sword knows the answer,
but how could you not?

00:54:45.619 --> 00:54:46.662
Minister IM!

00:54:46.912 --> 00:54:49.206
Soong-jae! Come at once!

00:54:49.206 --> 00:54:49.998
Right away!

00:54:50.457 --> 00:54:52.668
- Let's play a game!
- Yes, Your Highness.

00:54:52.668 --> 00:54:54.670
Come, you adorable things!

00:55:01.301 --> 00:55:04.596
Did you notice the way
the king looked at Jung-hwa?

00:55:05.055 --> 00:55:06.348
What do you mean?

00:55:08.308 --> 00:55:11.186
We must change
our way of thinking.

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:15.315
Consort JANG's girl is
no ordinary candidate.

00:55:15.315 --> 00:55:17.109
We can't lose this to JANG.

00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:21.029
Rush the liquor serving training
so Jung-hwa can move up.

00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:22.698
She is still far from ready.

00:55:22.698 --> 00:55:24.783
If we rush this
before she's ready...

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.324
Do you still
not know the king?

00:55:27.494 --> 00:55:29.663
He'll suck her dry
and throw her out,

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:34.293
it's better to send her in early,
and bring about a new change.

00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.342
Must Minister YU do this?

00:55:44.344 --> 00:55:45.512
Sit down!

00:55:47.306 --> 00:55:52.561
Imagine him as the king,
and entice him with drinks.

00:56:00.319 --> 00:56:01.361
Stop.

00:56:07.326 --> 00:56:08.452
Stop.

00:56:15.876 --> 00:56:16.919
Stop!

00:56:19.713 --> 00:56:20.756
Go on!

00:56:28.514 --> 00:56:29.556
Hear ye!

00:56:29.556 --> 00:56:33.810
Must I be humiliated
by a worthless pussy?

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:36.563
Maybe you don't look like the king.

00:56:36.563 --> 00:56:37.856
Remove her at once.

00:56:38.106 --> 00:56:40.317
SEOL is up next!

00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:46.323
May I

00:56:47.366 --> 00:56:50.410
offer you a precious view?

00:56:54.915 --> 00:56:58.252
Your Highness,
what do you see?

00:56:58.252 --> 00:57:01.797
It is a featherless quail!

00:57:03.298 --> 00:57:04.842
Your Highness!

00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:07.636
Now what do you see?

00:57:08.345 --> 00:57:12.850
It is pink, and wet,
like a ripe persimmon.

00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:16.603
I shall tell you what it is.

00:57:17.604 --> 00:57:23.318
What a strange sight,
what a bold sight!

00:57:23.318 --> 00:57:28.740
Like a mouth of an old monk,
so bald and toothless!

00:57:31.326 --> 00:57:37.124
Like a valley shaped by
centuries of rain.

00:57:37.124 --> 00:57:42.921
Like a groove in the wood,
made by a sharp axe.

00:57:42.921 --> 00:57:48.510
Like an oasis,
it is always wet and flowing.

00:57:50.179 --> 00:57:54.516
Like an abalone
waggling its tongue.

00:57:54.516 --> 00:57:59.062
Like a large seed
inside a dried persimmon.

00:57:59.062 --> 00:58:04.359
Like a proud rooster
with bright comb on its head.

00:58:05.777 --> 00:58:10.365
An abalone, a persimmon,
a rooster and water!

00:58:10.365 --> 00:58:13.368
It's a magnificent feast!

00:58:20.918 --> 00:58:21.919
Enough!

00:58:21.919 --> 00:58:24.421
I told you to treat him
like the king!

00:58:24.713 --> 00:58:26.757
I've made a grave mistake.

00:58:28.717 --> 00:58:31.345
JO Jung-hwa is next!

00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:40.521
Minister, we aren't here to
save appearances.

00:58:40.771 --> 00:58:44.691
May I suggest one of
the king's favorite plays?

00:58:44.691 --> 00:58:46.693
Will you accept?

00:58:47.694 --> 00:58:51.907
For every drink I down,
take an article off.

00:58:52.574 --> 00:58:56.203
If I pass out before
you're naked, you win.

00:58:56.203 --> 00:58:59.706
If I still stand,
your body is mine.

00:59:00.749 --> 00:59:03.836
This is not appropriate,
please retract.

00:59:03.836 --> 00:59:08.674
I didn't realize you could be
so easily offended.

00:59:10.592 --> 00:59:12.678
Please continue.

00:59:15.722 --> 00:59:18.725
Have you heard of
a nut-cruncher?

00:59:20.394 --> 00:59:22.104
What is it?

00:59:22.104 --> 00:59:24.690
It is an old method

00:59:25.774 --> 00:59:28.694
to tame bulls and hogs.

00:59:50.716 --> 00:59:55.179
A bull's hormones cause it
to behave aggressively,

00:59:55.179 --> 00:59:58.891
so it is better to castrate it
when the time comes.

00:59:58.891 --> 01:00:03.145
It is just a hunk of meat,
there's no use for the sack.

01:00:03.145 --> 01:00:06.773
It's a repulsive sack of skin,
it's better off gone!

01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:08.775
You bitch!

01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:13.238
Even if you are a king,
you must treat a lady fairly.

01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:16.074
You're no different than
animals with testicles.

01:00:16.366 --> 01:00:17.409
What?!

01:00:19.453 --> 01:00:20.746
Please stop.

01:00:41.225 --> 01:00:44.436
If you can't even endure this,
how will you bed the king?

01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:47.731
You'd better just quit.

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:51.693
I'll try again.

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:58.700
Murderous intent will
blunt your moves.

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:08.710
Have you fallen for her?

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:13.924
If you take a king's plaything,
3 generations will perish!

01:01:15.092 --> 01:01:17.052
We are grooming
is a beast, not king.

01:01:17.052 --> 01:01:23.517
When we scratch its itch,
we're rewarded handsomely.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.106
Once that stops,
the beast will swallow us whole!

01:01:30.691 --> 01:01:34.194
Eliminate useless feelings.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.158
Empty your mind!

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:44.538
Do you really intend to
have me bed him?

01:01:44.538 --> 01:01:45.702
What?

01:01:45.664 --> 01:01:47.875
Are you training me,

01:01:48.709 --> 01:01:51.420
or showing me
that you're jealous?

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.337
Nonsense!

01:01:52.337 --> 01:01:56.425
You asked me if I consider
myself as medicine.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.844
And what it treats.

01:02:00.387 --> 01:02:02.264
I'll answer you now.

01:02:08.353 --> 01:02:10.355
I am medicine
prescribed to you.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:15.194
But your feelings for me
defies the king.

01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:24.953
Is your daughter still sick?

01:02:26.205 --> 01:02:28.415
She's... recovering.

01:02:29.291 --> 01:02:34.922
But I just don't see her
around anymore.

01:02:43.931 --> 01:02:46.266
Let's be frank.

01:02:48.894 --> 01:02:52.940
You've gone too far
this time.

01:02:53.398 --> 01:02:54.900
What do you mean?

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.904
The king's tastes are
rather unique.

01:02:58.904 --> 01:03:05.911
Why is he attracted to
whores or butchers?

01:03:06.912 --> 01:03:13.877
Perhaps a tyrant and butcher
are a match made in heaven.

01:03:15.754 --> 01:03:17.631
Hurry up and get ready!

01:03:18.924 --> 01:03:20.551
Good afternoon, sir.

01:03:23.637 --> 01:03:24.972
Looking for this?

01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:32.187
Why is it so sharp?

01:03:32.187 --> 01:03:34.982
Just best prepared for
the performance.

01:05:53.954 --> 01:05:55.914
That's it...

01:05:56.915 --> 01:05:58.709
So fair...

01:06:43.921 --> 01:06:46.423
Come on.
Come at me!

01:07:01.396 --> 01:07:03.357
Protect the king!

01:07:03.357 --> 01:07:04.691
Your Highness!

01:07:04.691 --> 01:07:06.401
Protect him!

01:07:06.401 --> 01:07:08.403
Protect His Highness!

01:07:09.905 --> 01:07:11.365
Your Highness!

01:07:12.741 --> 01:07:15.327
Take him out of here!

01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:18.330
Hurry!

01:07:30.342 --> 01:07:32.344
It's poison-laced!

01:07:33.345 --> 01:07:35.389
A rare poison used
in China.

01:07:36.348 --> 01:07:38.350
This is the antidote,
treat him.

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:39.726
How did you get this?

01:07:40.018 --> 01:07:42.855
We're on the same boat now,
understood?

01:07:52.364 --> 01:07:54.324
Was that really necessary?

01:07:54.324 --> 01:07:58.871
How can I watch
a butcher bed the king?

01:07:59.329 --> 01:08:03.375
Plus, she must have been
scheming.

01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:05.377
It had to be done.

01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:09.339
Did you...

01:08:10.215 --> 01:08:12.384
know who she really was?

01:08:13.343 --> 01:08:17.347
You pathetic idiot!
Haven't I warned you?

01:08:17.347 --> 01:08:21.018
You can't give everything up
over petty feelings!

01:08:21.018 --> 01:08:23.312
Petty feelings?

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:27.357
I am not incompetent
like you.

01:08:27.733 --> 01:08:28.734
What?

01:08:28.734 --> 01:08:32.070
Obedience and flattery
will not work forever.

01:08:32.362 --> 01:08:33.155
Why you!

01:08:33.155 --> 01:08:36.325
When mother committed suicide
during exile,

01:08:36.909 --> 01:08:39.494
you did nothing but watch.

01:08:39.494 --> 01:08:41.205
- Shut your mouth!
- I'm not like you!

01:08:41.205 --> 01:08:43.707
I have the power
over the king!

01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:47.669
Because I am
king above the king!

01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:48.712
Shut up!

01:08:50.756 --> 01:08:54.134
Keep quiet
and watch how I do it.

01:08:54.134 --> 01:08:57.763
What would you
threaten me with?

01:08:58.305 --> 01:09:02.976
Forgot what you really gave
the king that night?

01:09:02.976 --> 01:09:07.064
Will you betray your father
over a girl?

01:09:07.064 --> 01:09:09.691
Like father, like son.

01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:13.779
Like a father who gave up
his family for power!

01:09:22.412 --> 01:09:26.708
The assassin's already dead,
and no clue whatsoever.

01:09:26.708 --> 01:09:29.711
How will you conclude
this matter?

01:09:29.711 --> 01:09:33.757
Since you favor Jung-hwa,

01:09:33.757 --> 01:09:37.135
other comforters
may have instigated this...

01:09:37.135 --> 01:09:38.387
This is treason.

01:09:39.054 --> 01:09:40.514
How dare you!

01:09:40.889 --> 01:09:42.224
In king's presence!

01:09:42.432 --> 01:09:43.517
Minister.

01:09:44.351 --> 01:09:45.894
Do you really believe that?

01:09:46.311 --> 01:09:50.357
Your Highness,
this has to be treason!

01:09:50.357 --> 01:09:55.320
What of your reputation
if your life was at risk over

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.906
mere comforters' jealousy?

01:09:58.323 --> 01:10:02.619
You must wipe out
your enemies with this chance.

01:10:03.328 --> 01:10:04.538
Who knows?

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:07.457
The real perpetrator
may be among them.

01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:13.714
Bring out the daughters
of traitors!

01:10:14.715 --> 01:10:17.217
This is unfair.
Please save me.

01:10:25.684 --> 01:10:28.687
Rash behavior will be met
with discipline.

01:10:29.646 --> 01:10:30.689
Get up!

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:33.650
Drag her out!

01:10:41.325 --> 01:10:44.703
My father obtained
this poison from China.

01:10:46.371 --> 01:10:47.956
With enough dosage,

01:10:48.832 --> 01:10:51.084
it could lead to death.

01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:55.797
During exile, my mother didn't
want to burden my father,

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.383
so she drank this.

01:10:59.551 --> 01:11:02.387
We obtained power that way,

01:11:03.388 --> 01:11:06.016
so we ended up like this.

01:11:07.434 --> 01:11:12.397
I've told you everything,
now it's your turn.

01:11:13.357 --> 01:11:15.526
Why did you attempt
to kill the king?

01:11:15.526 --> 01:11:18.987
- What do you mean?
- I knew Lord KIM Il-son.

01:11:19.613 --> 01:11:22.449
He was a respected official
and an upright man.

01:11:23.367 --> 01:11:26.745
He was executed for
criticizing the king.

01:11:26.745 --> 01:11:27.746
Please stop.

01:11:28.372 --> 01:11:30.541
- His remains must be...
- Stop!

01:11:31.083 --> 01:11:33.418
You do not deserve to
utter his name.

01:11:33.961 --> 01:11:35.671
You must give up
your revenge plot.

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.756
It's all pointless.

01:11:37.756 --> 01:11:42.678
For a power chaser,
it's all pointless to you.

01:11:44.012 --> 01:11:45.806
I will stop you.

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:49.351
If you do,
you will lose your life.

01:11:54.022 --> 01:11:56.233
I will use all my power

01:11:57.442 --> 01:11:58.569
to get you out.

01:11:58.569 --> 01:11:59.987
IM Soong-jae.

01:12:01.446 --> 01:12:03.490
Is that power...

01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:07.244
really yours?

01:12:20.507 --> 01:12:23.468
This is unjust!

01:12:23.468 --> 01:12:25.470
Minister IM has arrived!

01:12:27.431 --> 01:12:29.641
Minister! Minister!

01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:30.893
Minister!

01:12:31.435 --> 01:12:33.020
Please save me!

01:12:33.604 --> 01:12:35.898
This is unfair!

01:12:35.898 --> 01:12:38.775
Should have been careful,
Minister YU!

01:12:39.443 --> 01:12:41.778
Soong-jae...

01:12:41.778 --> 01:12:45.449
For Consort JANG's sake,
I'll let you keep your neck,

01:12:45.449 --> 01:12:47.784
so sit back and rest.

01:12:49.745 --> 01:12:53.498
You are all wives
and daughters

01:12:54.124 --> 01:12:56.835
of those who plotted my death!

01:12:56.835 --> 01:13:00.506
You'll be punished accordingly!

01:13:00.506 --> 01:13:02.633
Have mercy, Your Highness!

01:13:02.633 --> 01:13:08.472
But you may be pardoned
at today's shooting ceremony.

01:13:08.472 --> 01:13:14.978
And I will accept you back
as my comforters.

01:13:15.562 --> 01:13:18.065
We're eternally grateful!

01:13:20.192 --> 01:13:21.485
Prime Minister's daughter!

01:13:22.444 --> 01:13:23.487
Come forward!

01:13:32.454 --> 01:13:33.497
Come here.

01:13:40.796 --> 01:13:45.467
I'll aim, you just let
the arrow loose.

01:13:46.635 --> 01:13:48.011
Yes, Your Highness.

01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:00.899
Father! Father!

01:14:02.818 --> 01:14:04.820
Heaven's wrath...

01:14:05.487 --> 01:14:06.530
No!

01:14:10.492 --> 01:14:11.535
Remove her!
Next!

01:14:14.663 --> 01:14:18.709
If you look away,
you'll be flagged!

01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:22.629
Let the game begin.

01:14:23.005 --> 01:14:24.506
Treason

01:14:27.968 --> 01:14:29.636
Left!

01:14:29.636 --> 01:14:31.638
Next!

01:14:31.638 --> 01:14:34.975
He embraced the comforters
and fired the arrows.

01:14:35.684 --> 01:14:39.646
Left! Right!
All direct hits,

01:14:40.314 --> 01:14:43.692
the girls shed tears of blood.

01:14:44.651 --> 01:14:48.697
A twisted celebration!

01:14:48.697 --> 01:14:54.661
He danced
and jumped in joy,

01:14:54.661 --> 01:15:00.459
it was a gruesome
sight to behold!

01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:04.713
He's not it!

01:15:06.715 --> 01:15:08.675
He's not what?

01:15:08.675 --> 01:15:10.719
That man is not
my husband.

01:15:10.719 --> 01:15:16.099
You were mine all along,
Your Highness.

01:15:18.101 --> 01:15:20.145
How will you prove it?

01:15:31.907 --> 01:15:33.742
No!

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.703
Stop!

01:16:02.312 --> 01:16:05.691
If he's not your husband,
then he should die.

01:16:08.318 --> 01:16:09.319
Don't move!

01:16:09.653 --> 01:16:10.654
Your Highness!

01:16:15.868 --> 01:16:16.743
Come on!

01:16:17.661 --> 01:16:18.662
Do it!

01:16:30.674 --> 01:16:36.305
Tear her into pieces,
and feed her to the pigs!

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.641
Soong-jae,
the mood is ruined.

01:16:40.684 --> 01:16:41.727
Your Highness...

01:16:56.366 --> 01:16:58.660
So many rejects.

01:17:04.917 --> 01:17:09.421
Those who are called
are the contest rejects.

01:17:09.421 --> 01:17:13.133
You'll be reassigned
or become slaves!

01:17:13.634 --> 01:17:15.719
HAN Ja-soon, HYE Dang-hwa,

01:17:15.719 --> 01:17:18.639
HYANG Il-hwa, SO Hyang,

01:17:19.473 --> 01:17:21.850
SEOL, and JO Jung-hwa.

01:17:33.403 --> 01:17:34.279
What is it?

01:17:34.655 --> 01:17:37.324
Suffering such humiliation
over a butcher girl.

01:17:37.324 --> 01:17:38.659
What a pity.

01:17:40.035 --> 01:17:42.079
Stupid whore.

01:17:42.454 --> 01:17:46.500
Please ask Consort JANG
and put me back in.

01:17:47.334 --> 01:17:51.463
You want to be back
in the contest?

01:17:52.214 --> 01:17:55.592
Rumor says, a traitor's daughter
is a comforter.

01:17:57.302 --> 01:18:01.390
She was put in that place
by someone high up.

01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:11.191
Your Highness, may your
loyal subject speak?

01:18:11.275 --> 01:18:12.276
Yes, what is it?

01:18:12.442 --> 01:18:18.282
The contest may be ruined,
but a winner must be decided.

01:18:18.282 --> 01:18:25.247
And she must fulfill her duty.

01:18:25.747 --> 01:18:27.791
What should I do?

01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:32.171
Result is important,
but so is the process.

01:18:32.171 --> 01:18:38.093
I asked the head trainer to
recommend the best one.

01:18:38.093 --> 01:18:44.725
But, she came up with
two names instead.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.395
Two names?

01:18:49.021 --> 01:18:52.024
Then pit them
against each other.

01:18:52.024 --> 01:18:56.528
Ergo, I had them brought here.

01:18:56.528 --> 01:18:57.988
Bring them in!

01:19:04.244 --> 01:19:07.039
All right,
show your faces.

01:19:13.837 --> 01:19:14.880
Your Highness!

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:19.009
They no longer have
any right to compete.

01:19:19.009 --> 01:19:21.470
They've poured their souls
into the contest,

01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:25.057
and had been
outstanding candidates,

01:19:25.641 --> 01:19:29.102
so if they're deprived
of their chance,

01:19:29.102 --> 01:19:33.023
how can we say that
we're selecting the best?

01:19:33.023 --> 01:19:35.442
- Your Highness!
- Enough!

01:19:35.442 --> 01:19:38.028
I was sorry to let them go.

01:19:38.028 --> 01:19:40.822
Let's have a final match!

01:19:41.156 --> 01:19:43.992
Yes, Your Highness.

01:19:46.036 --> 01:19:49.164
- You're a schemer!
- Why're you so enraged?

01:19:50.207 --> 01:19:53.669
It's not like she'll die
in his bed.

01:19:54.294 --> 01:20:00.300
Or can you not love someone
tainted by the king?

01:20:03.011 --> 01:20:05.097
Must you be so cruel?

01:20:05.097 --> 01:20:08.016
No matter what,
you can't have her.

01:20:09.309 --> 01:20:11.436
She has no feelings for you.

01:20:12.104 --> 01:20:15.440
Why not just take her?
That's more like you.

01:20:15.983 --> 01:20:17.901
Love isn't your style.

01:20:20.737 --> 01:20:25.367
I will set you straight,
even if I have to kill you!

01:20:27.035 --> 01:20:30.163
I'll look forward to it,
my Lord.

01:20:47.055 --> 01:20:50.058
Use the hidden silver knife,
no mistake.

01:20:50.601 --> 01:20:52.603
Minister, you can't come in!

01:21:01.987 --> 01:21:04.531
I heard the rules,
so don't worry...

01:21:04.781 --> 01:21:06.575
So you'll do it
at all cost?

01:21:08.202 --> 01:21:10.078
Life itself is prison
for me.

01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:12.998
I'll take whatever punishment.

01:21:12.998 --> 01:21:14.583
Fine, if that's your wish.

01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:17.252
This is the final lesson.
Strip.

01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:19.338
- Lord!
- It's an order!

01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:30.224
Lose, you'll die,
win, you won't survive.

01:21:30.557 --> 01:21:33.143
If you so desire to die,
listen carefully.

01:21:33.727 --> 01:21:37.022
Remember this sensation
with your body.

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:43.987
Be aroused first,
and you lose.

01:21:43.987 --> 01:21:46.365
Not aroused, you lose.

01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:49.368
Control your own senses,

01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:51.870
and you become the best.

01:22:22.276 --> 01:22:23.527
It's not too late.

01:22:23.902 --> 01:22:25.821
Give it up
and leave at once.

01:22:27.239 --> 01:22:31.076
Do you still entertain
such futile hope?

01:22:31.076 --> 01:22:35.038
I promised never to
get you killed.

01:22:36.039 --> 01:22:41.044
Fate played tricks on us.
I owe you nothing.

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:44.047
Such warmth
from a cold heart.

01:22:45.966 --> 01:22:50.053
Even if my body isn't,
my heart is frozen solid.

01:22:50.846 --> 01:22:54.308
I will have you
and melt your heart.

01:22:56.101 --> 01:23:00.981
Even if it does beat,
I will not become yours.

01:23:01.982 --> 01:23:04.818
Tell me,
that you'll stop.

01:23:05.819 --> 01:23:06.945
Just tell me.

01:23:07.446 --> 01:23:11.491
Prove it with your life,
then I will say it.

01:23:37.976 --> 01:23:45.609
Most desirable woman would
seduce with her scent...

01:23:45.609 --> 01:23:47.022
I'm bored.

01:23:48.987 --> 01:23:53.033
One cannot claim to be the best
by killing a few soldiers.

01:23:53.033 --> 01:23:59.039
One must defeat
the enemy general.

01:24:01.625 --> 01:24:04.586
A tiger and a phoenix.

01:24:05.587 --> 01:24:08.048
Seduce each other
before me.

01:24:11.593 --> 01:24:17.975
I will award the winner
with the loser's pretty head.

01:24:22.563 --> 01:24:27.401
Your Highness,
this is against nature.

01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:30.404
Look at their eyes
and say that.

01:24:33.073 --> 01:24:37.369
We've forbid any contact
between comforters...

01:24:38.787 --> 01:24:42.791
Must I cut off your tongue?

01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:56.013
Begin.

01:25:06.773 --> 01:25:08.775
Good, very good.

01:25:23.999 --> 01:25:27.002
Good...

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.010
That's it!

01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:37.679
So Soong-jae trained
Jung-hwa?

01:25:37.679 --> 01:25:41.016
I did everything possible
for your pleasure.

01:25:50.984 --> 01:25:54.029
So, is it SEOL?

01:25:56.073 --> 01:25:58.867
Get into it!

01:26:04.998 --> 01:26:06.959
That's right.

01:26:12.256 --> 01:26:13.298
Yes.

01:26:14.258 --> 01:26:15.300
Bit more.

01:26:17.219 --> 01:26:19.221
Don't stay still.

01:26:20.931 --> 01:26:22.933
That's right!

01:26:34.236 --> 01:26:36.238
Jung-hwa this time?

01:26:40.617 --> 01:26:42.870
Jung-hwa, concentrate!

01:26:47.791 --> 01:26:49.084
Good!

01:26:53.255 --> 01:26:54.298
Very good!

01:26:55.757 --> 01:26:57.718
Oh come on.

01:26:59.219 --> 01:27:01.555
Flip over, flip!

01:27:03.557 --> 01:27:05.559
Don't lose, keep going!

01:27:06.185 --> 01:27:07.269
Seek your chance!

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:10.939
Keep going, harder!

01:27:22.534 --> 01:27:26.038
Keep moving, go on!

01:27:26.496 --> 01:27:28.498
It's not over! Go on!

01:27:28.498 --> 01:27:32.503
Concentrate! Keep going!

01:27:34.463 --> 01:27:36.507
We're almost there!

01:27:39.968 --> 01:27:44.139
Try harder.
Harder.

01:27:45.724 --> 01:27:47.518
Tired already?!

01:27:55.817 --> 01:27:58.820
Unable to finish
without an instrument?

01:28:03.825 --> 01:28:09.289
It is pitiful and desperate.

01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:15.546
A struggle towards the sun.

01:28:15.546 --> 01:28:21.552
Venting with a dagger in hand.

01:28:21.552 --> 01:28:28.559
The dragon's hand
swings ferociously,

01:28:28.559 --> 01:28:33.522
and the snake's tongue
remains silent.

01:28:33.522 --> 01:28:34.565
Soong-jae!

01:28:35.524 --> 01:28:39.528
This is what I've been
waiting for!

01:28:40.863 --> 01:28:45.325
Be aroused first, you lose,
not aroused, you still lose.

01:28:46.535 --> 01:28:48.996
Control your own senses,

01:28:49.496 --> 01:28:51.498
and you become the best.

01:29:17.524 --> 01:29:18.650
That's it!

01:29:27.409 --> 01:29:32.080
I'm dead,
I'll lose my head!

01:29:32.539 --> 01:29:33.540
Move aside.

01:29:34.499 --> 01:29:38.170
Didn't you promise me
a pretty head?

01:29:38.170 --> 01:29:40.547
And I'm fulfilling that now.

01:29:40.547 --> 01:29:41.840
Let the girl go.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.511
But she won't be pretty
if dead.

01:29:45.761 --> 01:29:46.803
What?

01:29:56.897 --> 01:30:00.567
A true Makhana lotus!

01:30:02.110 --> 01:30:05.989
- Your Highness...
- Make SEOL her slave and

01:30:05.989 --> 01:30:09.243
I'll bed the winner tomorrow.

01:30:14.498 --> 01:30:16.500
Let's go another round.

01:30:23.507 --> 01:30:27.761
Delicate flower,
with its crimson radiance,

01:30:29.555 --> 01:30:34.309
greets the young east
forgetting to bloom.

01:30:34.810 --> 01:30:39.898
Is the sky dark
blinded by madness?

01:30:40.941 --> 01:30:45.487
Or is the sky turned dark
by a bleak mind?

01:30:57.457 --> 01:30:59.334
My old friend.

01:31:00.085 --> 01:31:01.503
You still got it.

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.046
You're too generous.

01:31:03.297 --> 01:31:07.259
Now, as promised,
let's hear your request.

01:31:09.511 --> 01:31:13.182
Please select another girl
as your new consort.

01:31:17.477 --> 01:31:19.062
Are you in love with her?

01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:22.524
Do you remember when
we were young?

01:31:22.524 --> 01:31:25.235
I did everything
you told me to do.

01:31:25.235 --> 01:31:27.571
Even if it wasn't fit
for a boy.

01:31:27.571 --> 01:31:29.573
Yes, we were close
as these balls.

01:31:30.532 --> 01:31:35.370
So I beg of you,
give her to me!

01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:37.456
How dare you!

01:31:37.456 --> 01:31:43.504
Coveting a king's property
is punishable by death!

01:31:45.047 --> 01:31:46.507
Answer me this.

01:31:48.175 --> 01:31:53.305
Do you desire her
at the risk of your life?

01:32:02.898 --> 01:32:04.191
Soong-jae...

01:32:05.067 --> 01:32:08.028
Do you also believe
I'm mad?

01:32:08.028 --> 01:32:14.701
No sane man can live through
this turbulent age.

01:32:16.411 --> 01:32:17.955
Turbulent age?

01:32:18.497 --> 01:32:22.876
My madness has turned
the sky black!

01:32:24.837 --> 01:32:26.922
Will you stop me?

01:32:27.756 --> 01:32:30.509
Even after
deflowering thousands,

01:32:32.469 --> 01:32:36.056
the ghosts of the dead
won't leave me!

01:32:36.056 --> 01:32:40.561
I've gone utterly insane!

01:32:51.113 --> 01:32:56.076
Life is like
dew on grass leaves...

01:32:59.288 --> 01:33:00.497
Go on.

01:33:01.331 --> 01:33:03.125
Please stop me.

01:33:05.043 --> 01:33:09.506
Your Majesty,
kill me instead!

01:33:09.506 --> 01:33:12.092
No, no!

01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:16.680
How can I kill
a loyal subject?

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:23.145
You couldn't fulfill your duty
due to my lack of virtue!

01:33:23.145 --> 01:33:25.022
Stop me...

01:33:25.022 --> 01:33:27.816
Please! Please!

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:31.361
Your Highness!

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:36.033
Let go!

01:33:39.411 --> 01:33:40.412
Your Majesty!

01:33:40.537 --> 01:33:41.830
Baby!

01:33:46.502 --> 01:33:49.505
Who dared to bother
my little baby.

01:33:49.755 --> 01:33:50.756
My baby.

01:33:51.965 --> 01:33:54.551
Rest easy in
mommy's bosom.

01:33:56.553 --> 01:33:59.634
That's it,
everything's all right.

01:34:03.769 --> 01:34:07.314
I'll take care of him,
leave us now.

01:34:41.473 --> 01:34:43.517
It is time, my lady.

01:34:53.193 --> 01:34:55.153
I'm here for
the new consort.

01:35:19.803 --> 01:35:22.890
This was the only way
to save you.

01:35:22.890 --> 01:35:26.310
The boat will depart soon,
don't ever come back.

01:35:32.983 --> 01:35:33.984
But how...

01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:38.030
It was her request.

01:36:09.228 --> 01:36:10.562
Are you ready?

01:36:15.776 --> 01:36:18.195
Make no mistake.

01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:38.465
We cannot
miss this chance.

01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:49.643
If you hear the signal,
kill everyone.

01:36:50.727 --> 01:36:54.523
Even the new consort.

01:37:07.244 --> 01:37:10.455
I've waited long for
this moment.

01:37:11.915 --> 01:37:16.628
I too felt the same.

01:37:41.361 --> 01:37:42.946
Your Highness!

01:37:43.405 --> 01:37:47.576
Before you can have me,
you must solve a riddle.

01:37:49.494 --> 01:37:50.537
A riddle?

01:37:51.914 --> 01:37:52.915
Go on then.

01:37:53.165 --> 01:37:57.628
It normally floats, but sinks
at times.

01:37:58.128 --> 01:38:00.756
You have 3 chances
to solve it.

01:38:10.933 --> 01:38:12.935
Stop right there!

01:38:52.599 --> 01:38:54.601
Floats but sinks?

01:38:54.601 --> 01:38:56.186
Can a man ride it?

01:38:56.186 --> 01:38:57.771
You're close.

01:38:57.771 --> 01:38:59.934
A horse?

01:38:59.857 --> 01:39:04.528
Your Highness!
You really don't know?

01:39:09.575 --> 01:39:11.577
Or a palanquin?

01:39:12.619 --> 01:39:16.582
One last chance,
what is your answer?

01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:46.361
It's a boat!

01:39:46.361 --> 01:39:49.656
It normally floats,
but sinks in harsh waters.

01:39:50.032 --> 01:39:55.037
I shall ride you,
you're my boat today!

01:39:58.582 --> 01:40:01.460
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

01:40:03.212 --> 01:40:06.965
It keeps a boat afloat
or sinks it.

01:40:08.425 --> 01:40:09.426
It is water.

01:40:10.052 --> 01:40:13.096
It is said, the people is water,
the king is the boat.

01:40:13.096 --> 01:40:16.725
You're the boat that
the water will sink today!

01:40:36.078 --> 01:40:37.162
Sly bitch...

01:40:40.666 --> 01:40:43.252
Your Highness!
Are you all right?!

01:40:52.177 --> 01:40:53.303
Who hired you?

01:40:54.054 --> 01:40:58.684
The king is not fit to rule,
so I did what anyone'd do.

01:41:00.477 --> 01:41:01.520
Bring him in.

01:41:07.609 --> 01:41:10.487
Lord JO,
is this your daughter?

01:41:14.533 --> 01:41:17.119
Spare me,
Your Highness.

01:41:17.119 --> 01:41:19.371
Please...

01:41:20.289 --> 01:41:21.748
Minister IM...

01:41:21.748 --> 01:41:24.126
Please speak on my behalf!

01:41:24.126 --> 01:41:26.378
How could we...

01:41:27.838 --> 01:41:29.089
Next.

01:41:33.677 --> 01:41:38.307
My lady,
glad to see you alive.

01:41:40.058 --> 01:41:46.398
You there,
is this your daughter?

01:41:49.026 --> 01:41:52.196
No better than
a mad butcher!

01:41:52.196 --> 01:41:53.947
Get a grip!

01:41:53.947 --> 01:41:55.490
Please!

01:41:58.076 --> 01:41:59.077
Next.

01:42:08.754 --> 01:42:10.130
Here it is,
Your Highness.

01:42:11.757 --> 01:42:14.718
This was hard to find.

01:42:14.718 --> 01:42:19.097
I'll ask for the last time.

01:42:19.097 --> 01:42:22.434
Is she your daughter?

01:42:23.227 --> 01:42:25.103
Lord KIM Il-son!

01:42:25.103 --> 01:42:26.897
Father...

01:42:26.897 --> 01:42:28.524
Why are you silent?

01:42:33.862 --> 01:42:36.907
So disloyal!

01:42:36.907 --> 01:42:40.410
Why isn't anyone
answering me?!

01:42:40.410 --> 01:42:43.872
Why! Why?!

01:42:50.337 --> 01:42:52.256
You are pathetic.

01:42:52.256 --> 01:42:53.465
What?

01:42:53.715 --> 01:42:57.636
Surrounded by pigs
busy stuffing themselves,

01:42:58.428 --> 01:43:00.681
with your eyes and
ears shut,

01:43:01.431 --> 01:43:03.517
who'll tell you the truth?

01:43:04.434 --> 01:43:09.439
What is the truth you're
so desperate to tell?

01:43:09.439 --> 01:43:11.066
Go on, tell me.

01:43:11.567 --> 01:43:17.531
Become a human,
if not a king.

01:43:27.958 --> 01:43:28.876
Soong-jae.

01:43:29.334 --> 01:43:35.132
Is this a masterpiece or
should I put your name on it?

01:43:35.132 --> 01:43:40.262
I am solely to be blamed
for my son's faults.

01:43:40.262 --> 01:43:44.850
Please take my life
and forgive him!

01:43:45.434 --> 01:43:46.476
Forgive?

01:43:47.686 --> 01:43:49.855
How can I forgive anyone,
when I can't even

01:43:49.855 --> 01:43:52.149
recognize my mother's
belongings?

01:43:53.859 --> 01:43:58.697
Remember this?
A symbol of our relationship.

01:43:58.697 --> 01:44:04.870
Without this, I'd still be
a plaything for her enemies.

01:44:05.370 --> 01:44:09.499
So let me ask,
why'd you bring me this?

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.379
I was sincerely looking after
your well-being...

01:44:14.379 --> 01:44:15.756
My well-being?

01:44:17.424 --> 01:44:23.222
I used it to solidify my throne,
and you regained power.

01:44:24.014 --> 01:44:26.141
Your sincerity is noted.

01:44:27.226 --> 01:44:29.269
So can I throw it away now?

01:44:33.607 --> 01:44:34.525
Your Highness!

01:44:35.108 --> 01:44:36.401
But it's your mother's article!

01:44:36.401 --> 01:44:42.276
It's my mother's,
so why do you care?

01:44:43.867 --> 01:44:48.288
The late king worried about
seeds of trouble,

01:44:49.831 --> 01:44:54.628
so any articles that
belonged to the queen

01:44:54.628 --> 01:44:57.339
were all destroyed.

01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:02.261
Father...

01:45:09.476 --> 01:45:12.306
Did you really took me
for a fool?

01:45:12.479 --> 01:45:17.985
The late queen was indeed
killed by conspiracy...

01:45:17.985 --> 01:45:19.278
I'll ask again!

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:26.577
When a king makes an error,
should his subjects object,

01:45:26.577 --> 01:45:30.581
or should they comply
for the fear of their lives?

01:45:30.581 --> 01:45:32.291
A loyal subject should...

01:45:32.291 --> 01:45:38.046
Pandering to my needs,
regardless of its consequences,

01:45:38.046 --> 01:45:40.215
you're a treacherous subject!

01:45:40.215 --> 01:45:43.051
You blinded me with flattery,

01:45:43.051 --> 01:45:48.348
you're a traitor
who ruined this nation!

01:45:50.267 --> 01:45:54.188
Your Highness!
Please take my life!

01:45:54.188 --> 01:45:57.566
No loyal servants exist
in my court,

01:45:58.650 --> 01:46:00.354
only faithful dogs.

01:46:00.861 --> 01:46:07.868
But a dog should not be
put down over one bite.

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:24.843
What an interesting family.

01:46:24.843 --> 01:46:28.889
A father, who offered
his own wife's keepsake,

01:46:28.889 --> 01:46:32.476
and his son,
who offered his lover.

01:46:37.898 --> 01:46:41.860
What will you do
for me now?

01:46:45.572 --> 01:46:48.617
Can you bring me
paint for the drawing?

01:47:02.256 --> 01:47:03.298
Get out.

01:47:12.850 --> 01:47:14.268
Do it.

01:47:15.352 --> 01:47:18.856
I've no reason to live...

01:47:45.132 --> 01:47:46.884
Yes, this is it.

01:47:51.096 --> 01:47:55.851
This is my reward to you,
so retain your loyalty.

01:47:55.851 --> 01:47:58.520
I'm eternally grateful.

01:47:59.521 --> 01:48:02.608
And recruit for the next
group of comforters.

01:48:03.233 --> 01:48:04.943
No mistakes this time.

01:48:04.943 --> 01:48:06.570
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:48:16.997 --> 01:48:20.542
Dying in your hand
will be an honor.

01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:40.562
She'll be taken
out of the palace.

01:48:40.562 --> 01:48:42.773
Treat her well.

01:48:43.982 --> 01:48:47.569
That is the reason
why I kept you alive.

01:48:55.702 --> 01:48:57.120
This was your sister's,

01:48:57.538 --> 01:49:00.290
and the only detachable one
from the screen.

01:49:00.541 --> 01:49:02.918
I'd have used it too,

01:49:02.918 --> 01:49:06.588
to avenge a sister
who met a shameful death.

01:49:08.799 --> 01:49:11.927
Shouldn't have trusted
a whore.

01:49:14.096 --> 01:49:16.348
Care for an amusement?

01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:21.270
When blood river soaks
the dry land,

01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:23.981
old boat's clamors
shake the world!

01:49:23.981 --> 01:49:25.566
Cowardly boatman!

01:49:25.566 --> 01:49:28.944
Seize the moment to build
a new boat!

01:49:31.864 --> 01:49:35.909
Treacherous words from
a treacherous subject.

01:49:38.829 --> 01:49:40.831
Round everyone up!

01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:43.584
Close the door,
another purge is coming!

01:49:43.584 --> 01:49:49.548
Hide yourself,
they'll take you away!

01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:52.885
You are all pigs!

01:49:52.885 --> 01:49:55.596
Fattened up
on the king's lands,

01:49:55.596 --> 01:49:58.557
and offered
back to the king!

01:49:58.557 --> 01:50:03.020
That is the very reason
of your life!

01:50:04.521 --> 01:50:08.567
Peasant blood and sweat
fueled the king's madness,

01:50:09.526 --> 01:50:13.488
it knew no boundary.

01:50:13.488 --> 01:50:17.534
If the screams of his populace
don't stop his dance,

01:50:17.534 --> 01:50:21.538
he must be stopped
at any cost.

01:50:21.538 --> 01:50:25.375
When IM returns with
new comforters,

01:50:25.375 --> 01:50:30.005
public's rage will be at its limit,
we'll start the rebellion.

01:50:30.005 --> 01:50:33.926
You bastards!
Heaven will judge you.

01:50:34.468 --> 01:50:36.970
Go to hell, you bastards!

01:50:37.513 --> 01:50:39.598
Don't you have family?!

01:50:50.859 --> 01:50:51.902
How is she?

01:50:52.444 --> 01:50:53.904
She's a stubborn one.

01:51:00.869 --> 01:51:03.330
Why is everyone
so desperate to die?

01:51:18.178 --> 01:51:21.390
I've returned from duty,
Your Highness.

01:51:25.894 --> 01:51:27.312
Where is everyone?

01:51:27.312 --> 01:51:31.525
Due to long travel,
I've allowed them to rest.

01:51:31.525 --> 01:51:33.527
But I should at least
greet them!

01:51:33.527 --> 01:51:38.031
They will look better
when they are rested.

01:51:40.492 --> 01:51:44.538
All right,
I can wait a night.

01:51:44.538 --> 01:51:50.460
You must also be tired,
so rest up.

01:51:52.171 --> 01:51:55.215
Go now.
Take a rest.

01:51:56.049 --> 01:51:58.135
Thank you, Your Highness.

01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:06.226
Anyone there?

01:52:06.226 --> 01:52:09.563
Yes, Your Highness,
are you all right?

01:52:09.563 --> 01:52:11.356
They should all be
rested, right?

01:52:11.648 --> 01:52:12.441
Pardon me?

01:52:12.441 --> 01:52:14.860
I wish to see
the comforters now.

01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:17.738
But I must alert
the security guards...

01:52:17.738 --> 01:52:20.782
You can be
my security detail!

01:52:20.908 --> 01:52:21.992
Get ready at once!

01:52:22.492 --> 01:52:26.622
Your Highness,
Minister IM is here.

01:52:29.541 --> 01:52:31.502
Soong-jae!

01:52:31.919 --> 01:52:33.921
If you had everything ready,

01:52:33.921 --> 01:52:37.299
you should've told me before
I got drunk.

01:52:38.008 --> 01:52:39.009
Forgive me.

01:52:39.009 --> 01:52:41.011
I was too conscious
of others.

01:52:41.011 --> 01:52:43.013
It's okay, very good.

01:52:44.014 --> 01:52:50.312
Everyone's so afraid of me,
always, 'Your Highness!'

01:52:50.312 --> 01:52:52.356
Shut the hell up!

01:52:52.981 --> 01:52:54.233
Damn it!

01:52:54.233 --> 01:52:56.235
- Soong-jae!
- Yes, bud!

01:52:56.777 --> 01:53:02.991
Let's have some real fun,
like we did as kids!

01:53:13.043 --> 01:53:15.003
Girls!

01:53:17.047 --> 01:53:20.050
Soong-jae,
where is everyone?

01:53:21.969 --> 01:53:26.139
What's going on?
Don't joke around!

01:53:26.139 --> 01:53:27.015
Do you remember?

01:53:27.516 --> 01:53:30.060
The girl role play,
that you liked?

01:53:30.561 --> 01:53:31.603
What?

01:53:32.271 --> 01:53:37.568
Now, you take the role
that I always had to play.

01:53:39.236 --> 01:53:41.154
You must be mad!

01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:45.993
If you want it intact,
hide it.

01:53:54.042 --> 01:53:56.044
What's going on?!

01:53:56.044 --> 01:53:59.047
- My Lord!
- What happened?!

01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:05.053
Don't be upset
over the past.

01:54:05.053 --> 01:54:08.724
I understand,
I'll forget about this.

01:54:09.850 --> 01:54:11.101
So sheath your sword.

01:54:14.813 --> 01:54:16.523
Sheath your sword!

01:54:18.483 --> 01:54:23.071
The world will be better off
without it.

01:54:23.989 --> 01:54:25.157
Fine, fine.

01:54:25.490 --> 01:54:27.034
You think I won't do it?

01:54:27.034 --> 01:54:28.035
I will...

01:54:38.045 --> 01:54:40.047
Your Majesty!

01:54:48.472 --> 01:54:49.473
Yes, Lord!

01:55:03.278 --> 01:55:04.279
Enough!

01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:08.450
How dare you
look at me that way!

01:55:08.992 --> 01:55:12.329
Contempt for the king
won't go unpunished!

01:55:12.329 --> 01:55:18.001
I only see a murderer,
so where is the king?

01:55:30.973 --> 01:55:33.892
Do you still feel inferior
for your mother's passing?

01:55:34.351 --> 01:55:37.229
Since you love blood so much,
how fitting!

01:55:38.105 --> 01:55:40.190
Why are you doing this?

01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:44.027
Evil wins power,
so all desire to be more evil.

01:55:44.403 --> 01:55:48.031
It's the source of our tragedy,
and what tortures your soul!

01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:50.033
I shall uproot it.

01:55:50.576 --> 01:55:53.328
Even if I die,
you can't take my place!

01:55:53.328 --> 01:55:58.834
Friend! Evil is replaced by
a greater evil.

01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:03.297
You underestimate me!

01:56:09.011 --> 01:56:10.012
Your Highness.

01:56:10.721 --> 01:56:15.017
I'll bring out the comforters,
and leave you be.

01:56:15.601 --> 01:56:20.147
Pale skin, full buttocks,
sharp nose tip.

01:56:21.023 --> 01:56:23.400
They fit your taste,

01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:26.987
so please fulfill your duty
as a king.

01:56:26.987 --> 01:56:28.197
You bastard!

01:56:29.489 --> 01:56:32.034
Stop right there!

01:57:03.065 --> 01:57:06.068
Is anyone outside?

01:57:10.781 --> 01:57:11.990
Let's go!

01:57:15.619 --> 01:57:17.704
Do not back down!

01:57:18.956 --> 01:57:22.709
We must take the palace!

01:57:23.377 --> 01:57:25.420
Captain!

01:57:28.090 --> 01:57:29.591
Minister YU,
you brought reinforcement.

01:57:29.591 --> 01:57:32.219
We can't last very long
this way.

01:57:32.219 --> 01:57:33.679
Still no orders from the king?

01:57:33.679 --> 01:57:36.181
He's nowhere to be found.

01:57:40.185 --> 01:57:42.229
The palace gate is open!

01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:44.356
Advance!

01:57:46.233 --> 01:57:47.276
Minister!

01:57:51.196 --> 01:57:53.198
What took you so long?

01:57:53.198 --> 01:57:57.244
I want nothing more than
to save this country!

01:57:58.203 --> 01:58:00.622
I heard that fox Soong-jae
visited you.

01:58:01.206 --> 01:58:05.252
How can you lead the uprising
with his help?

01:58:11.842 --> 01:58:15.220
And, I know I'm late
to the party,

01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:19.266
but reserve me a spot
in the court.

01:58:19.725 --> 01:58:21.185
Advance!

01:58:26.273 --> 01:58:31.236
IM Soong-jae!

01:58:32.279 --> 01:58:33.530
Traitors!

01:58:33.947 --> 01:58:35.574
Are you not afraid
of the heavens?!

01:58:35.949 --> 01:58:37.743
Do you not know who I am?!

01:58:37.743 --> 01:58:38.744
Of course we do!

01:58:38.744 --> 01:58:42.956
A former concubine,
who feeds off the populace,

01:58:42.956 --> 01:58:47.336
you're just a temptress
who fueled tyranny!

01:58:47.753 --> 01:58:48.962
Take her out!

01:58:49.171 --> 01:58:51.965
You're just a pathetic pawn!

01:58:51.965 --> 01:58:54.426
I was a loyal subject...

01:58:55.552 --> 01:58:57.429
Die, you bitch!

01:59:20.035 --> 01:59:23.539
Do it! I can't endure
more shame!

01:59:23.539 --> 01:59:25.582
You've done so much harm,

01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:28.210
you call this shame?

01:59:28.210 --> 01:59:32.589
It wouldn't be enough to
rip you to shreds!

01:59:38.512 --> 01:59:41.849
What are you waiting for?
Kill me!

01:59:51.191 --> 01:59:54.945
Did you think you could
redeem yourself this way?

01:59:55.529 --> 01:59:57.823
I too have blood
on my hands,

01:59:58.448 --> 02:00:01.243
how am I any different
from the mad king?

02:00:03.370 --> 02:00:06.874
If you could at least
laugh at me...

02:00:07.749 --> 02:00:09.251
Stay alive.

02:00:10.586 --> 02:00:13.255
Your sins will not
wash away so easily.

02:00:13.797 --> 02:00:17.759
Survive and live to undo
all your wrongs.

02:00:18.218 --> 02:00:19.928
Undo everything.

02:00:22.723 --> 02:00:26.727
Majesty, I'll take care of her,
please stay back!

02:00:29.188 --> 02:00:30.230
Your Highness!

02:00:33.233 --> 02:00:37.863
Why're you wearing
the king's robe?

02:00:37.863 --> 02:00:40.657
I am playing my part as
the treacherous subject.

02:00:40.657 --> 02:00:43.452
What have you done
to deserve it?!

02:00:43.452 --> 02:00:46.747
A hero is a nobody
during peace,

02:00:46.747 --> 02:00:50.667
and a moral man is useless
on the battlefield.

02:00:50.667 --> 02:00:53.003
What's the difference?

02:00:53.003 --> 02:00:54.046
Father!

02:00:54.505 --> 02:00:55.839
No, my son.

02:00:56.507 --> 02:00:57.508
It's not too late.

02:00:57.508 --> 02:00:58.926
Where did you hide
the king?

02:00:59.218 --> 02:01:01.254
We should kill him first!

02:01:01.178 --> 02:01:02.930
Power cannot be contained.

02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:04.181
Nonsense!

02:01:04.181 --> 02:01:06.767
Like you said, we can build
a higher levee!

02:01:06.767 --> 02:01:08.185
Have you gone blind?

02:01:08.185 --> 02:01:09.770
You're the blind one!

02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:13.315
I know you started everything
for that bitch!

02:01:13.732 --> 02:01:17.819
Move aside, I'll kill her
and bring you back!

02:01:17.819 --> 02:01:20.822
Enough!

02:01:21.782 --> 02:01:26.745
This is the only way for me
as your son.

02:01:32.751 --> 02:01:34.795
No, no, please!

02:01:34.795 --> 02:01:36.046
Please no! Please!

02:01:36.755 --> 02:01:37.798
You can't! Please!

02:01:37.798 --> 02:01:39.758
No! No!

02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:45.138
Soong-jae, my son!

02:01:45.138 --> 02:01:50.185
For upholding tyranny,
creating a mad king,

02:01:50.602 --> 02:01:54.773
blinding you with power,
being a terrible son,

02:01:54.773 --> 02:01:56.817
I'll pay for it all.

02:01:58.527 --> 02:01:59.570
Please...

02:02:01.238 --> 02:02:05.117
No, you have to live!

02:02:05.117 --> 02:02:08.245
How can I face your mother
if you die like this?

02:02:08.245 --> 02:02:10.289
- No, please!
- Fools...

02:02:11.123 --> 02:02:13.625
How did you not know?

02:02:19.673 --> 02:02:22.342
You destroyed both of us.

02:02:22.342 --> 02:02:26.263
We could have accomplished
so much together.

02:02:53.999 --> 02:02:58.962
I thought we had the dragon
but it's only 2 vipers.

02:03:00.005 --> 02:03:02.007
Drinking bud,

02:03:02.883 --> 02:03:05.969
it will only end by
taking my life, right?

02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:08.680
Do you have a last wish?

02:03:09.014 --> 02:03:13.977
Take that whore,
and send her far away.

02:03:14.978 --> 02:03:17.022
She's rather irritating.

02:03:29.243 --> 02:03:31.954
Do you have any regrets?

02:03:32.454 --> 02:03:33.497
Regrets?

02:03:34.998 --> 02:03:41.505
I had the king and the world
at my fingertips.

02:03:42.631 --> 02:03:45.050
I had my share
of the world.

02:03:45.634 --> 02:03:51.974
Your vile reputation will
last a millennium.

02:03:57.729 --> 02:04:00.983
The king is not here,
move out!

02:04:09.032 --> 02:04:15.289
Rest easy now.

02:04:51.033 --> 02:04:54.036
Do you also covet
my comforters?

02:04:56.955 --> 02:05:01.335
Go on and take them.

02:05:06.006 --> 02:05:11.428
The pigs had the last laugh!

02:05:15.974 --> 02:05:19.770
SEPT. 2, 1506 A.D.
After Joseon's first uprising,

02:05:19.770 --> 02:05:23.482
The Beauty Recruits perished
With King Yeonsan-gun.

02:05:23.482 --> 02:05:29.029
Those who led the reform soon became
the new treacherous subjects.

02:05:30.989 --> 02:05:34.535
Not quite civil officers,

02:05:34.952 --> 02:05:37.037
but more than a concubine.

02:05:37.037 --> 02:05:40.666
Not quite selection process,

02:05:40.666 --> 02:05:44.419
but exercising power
that was given.

02:05:45.212 --> 02:05:48.006
How could I best explain this?

02:05:49.758 --> 02:05:52.261
So what happened
to the mad king in the end?

02:05:52.261 --> 02:05:53.971
Haven't you been listening?

02:05:53.971 --> 02:05:57.724
His sexual appetite
got him banished,

02:05:57.724 --> 02:06:01.103
so comforters were what
got him killed!

02:06:01.103 --> 02:06:02.771
Good riddance!

02:06:02.771 --> 02:06:07.776
Tell us once more about how
the treacherous IMs were killed!

02:06:07.776 --> 02:06:09.194
Yeah!

02:06:11.196 --> 02:06:14.908
The IMs tried to help
a concubine,

02:06:14.908 --> 02:06:18.579
and the two were found
in ashes.

02:06:20.539 --> 02:06:22.749
Do that to me too!

02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:25.794
Their ashes were spitted on,

02:06:25.794 --> 02:06:31.008
and they deserved
the worst fate in the world.

02:06:32.843 --> 02:06:35.512
If your drinks are empty,
get going!

02:06:35.721 --> 02:06:36.763
Hurry!

02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:41.810
It's here! It's starting!

02:06:52.779 --> 02:06:57.784
It is 3 years into
the era of tyranny,

02:06:59.286 --> 02:07:05.751
the two IMs were
up to no good,

02:07:05.751 --> 02:07:09.796
so desperate to get on
the king's good side,

02:07:11.256 --> 02:07:13.800
can't just let this
cruelty continue!

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:18.805
The enraged mountain god
sent a tiger!

02:07:21.517 --> 02:07:25.020
I'm gonna hurt my back!

02:07:25.604 --> 02:07:28.732
Empty your pockets!

02:07:33.445 --> 02:07:39.243
It searched the world for
deluded subjects,

02:07:39.243 --> 02:07:44.748
It searched and searched
but could not find them.

02:07:44.748 --> 02:07:48.794
Hidden behind a human mask,
can't tell what's in his heart.

02:07:51.505 --> 02:07:57.719
All right, feed on my body,

02:07:57.719 --> 02:08:01.181
and if you're a good man,
I'll strengthen your body,

02:08:01.181 --> 02:08:06.770
or I'll become poison
and kill you.

02:08:14.736 --> 02:08:16.989
I found you!
