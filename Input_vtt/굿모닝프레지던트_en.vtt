[children screaming, laughing]

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:13.013
[uplifting music]

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.848
[fireworks exploding]

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:17.918
[bright music]

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.720
[ringing sound]

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:29.096
[upbeat music plays]

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:05.232
[newscaster] With tensions
rising over the protracted

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.569
suspension of the
National Assembly..

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:11.104
Assembly will adjourn again?

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.775
It’ll be decided
after tomorrow’s

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:17.044
ruling-opposition summit.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.912
[news on TV continues]

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:20.747
What a pathetic bunch..

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.817
Have they no shame in wasting
tax payers’ money?

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:25.752
The proposed presidential pardon

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.054
is stirring things up.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.090
How come it’s in papers before

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.625
anything’s even been decided?

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:35.662
[sighs]

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.701
[Jeong-ho] Fantastic!

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.437
PRESIDENTIAL PARDON
FORGIVENESS OR STRATEGY?

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:46.006
[news playing on TV]

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.509
Your breakfast is getting cold.

00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:54.348
PRESIDENT ATTENDS WORLD CUP
LOTTERY EVENTS

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:59.753
[Jeong-ho on TV] “If I win,
I’ll make all the donations”.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.123
[Jeong-ho] I don’t have long
left in my tenure.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.626
Do I have to attend
all these events?

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.427
Would you look at that?

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.296
A President marking
lottery numbers..

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:10.731
Pathetic!

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.199
[staff]
I’ll make a note of that, sir.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.501
[newscaster] President Kim

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:18.338
wished success in
hosting the World Cup

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:21.208
and for happiness
of fellow Koreans..

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.645
This is good.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.416
I made it spicier than usual.

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:31.018
I thought you had a quite

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.486
a few drinks at
dinner last night.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.023
Russians love a drink,
don’t they?

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.728
Maybe this is why they
tried to change the law.

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:45.632
To enjoy the tasty
foods for longer.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:51.405
Dictators must have
had the best chefs. [laughs]

00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:58.045
[ceremonial music plays]

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.263
GOOD MORNING PRESIDENT

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.902
All these for tomorrow’s summit?

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.505
It’s a summit meeting.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:25.939
Do they expect me
to do their job

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:27.441
for the entire year?

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:30.277
Cha is not an easy man.

00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:32.379
It won’t hurt to be prepared.

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:35.582
What’s on tonight’s agenda?

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.018
The presidential pardon, sir.

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:41.221
We advise you to reconsider.

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.791
[Jeung-ho sighs]

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.629
[man]
I don’t think it’s an issue of

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:51.164
personal forgiveness.

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:53.867
The nation and
our recent history

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:55.903
isn’t ready to forgive them.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.206
Moreover, there is
the outstanding issue

00:03:59.273 --> 00:04:01.608
of an unaccounted-for
slush fund.

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:04.711
[man] The public sentiment
remains strong.

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:07.614
You might take the fall
for your generosity.

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:11.084
What are your
thoughts, Minister?

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:14.555
Do you think I’m going
over the line, too?

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:22.596
[Kyung-ja] I was the chief
justice for the case.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.399
They were tried as
former Presidents

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.568
and there was huge pressure.

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:31.505
But, be it death penalty or
life imprisonment.

00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:34.741
Sentencing them
was only possible

00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:36.276
because the public approved.

00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:38.378
I believe you should
approach this issue

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.214
from that perspective.

00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:43.617
I’m the President
of this country.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.419
A special pardon
is the President’s right

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:46.787
under the Constitution.

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:49.423
Am I mistaken?

00:04:50.324 --> 00:04:51.225
[exhales]

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.328
No, it’s not unlawful, sir.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:04:59.867
[sighs]

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:12.312
[both grunt]

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.881
What’s all that?

00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:17.417
I have a big presentation
at the seminar.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.087
Couldn’t you have gotten a cab?

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.855
Why spend money on a cab?

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.859
This car was given
to me for official duty

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.027
not for picking up husbands.

00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:28.495
All right, all right..

00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:31.899
[woman on TV] Take the
presidential pardon

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:32.900
for instance..

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.669
Would it have been
possible earlier in his tenure?

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.804
[man] We’re dancing
around the same topic.

00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:41.475
Let’s not distort
his good intentions.

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:44.144
-Turn up the volume, please?
-Yes, ma’am.

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:45.179
[man] The current President
was persecuted

00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:46.146
by the military government.

00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:49.249
In other words,
he was the biggest victim.

00:05:49.316 --> 00:05:50.784
Why would he want to do this?

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.153
To fulfill one of
this government’s

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.957
greatest objectives
- to unite the nation.

00:05:57.191 --> 00:06:00.394
What about the slush fund?

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.497
[moderator] Please approach
the subject more logically.

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:05.132
Please let me speak..

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.868
We deeply regret that, too.

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:09.736
It’s up to the judiciary bodies

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.171
to investigate the matter fully.

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:12.673
But, how do you expect
the justice department

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:13.774
to do a proper job.

00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:15.709
When the government is clearly
lacking the will.

00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:17.444
Are you accusing us
of undermining

00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:19.379
the principles of
division of powers?

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:21.114
In this day and age?

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:23.417
[woman on TV]
What’s the point of convicting

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:25.586
and sentencing
them to life in prison

00:06:25.652 --> 00:06:28.355
when they are
let off right away?

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:31.625
What’s the point of giving them
the death penalty,

00:06:31.692 --> 00:06:34.294
only to free them
after a year and a half?

00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:35.662
[man] It was 2 years.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.264
[woman] Get your facts right.

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:40.234
It was 20 months to be precise!

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:46.073
[cameras clicking]

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:48.775
How are you?
It’s been a long time.

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:50.043
How have you been, sir?

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.913
You look more handsome
than ever.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.349
They’re referring to you
as the JFK of Korea.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.050
That must be
an exaggeration, surely.

00:06:57.184 --> 00:06:58.552
[both laugh]

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:01.855
[cameras clicking continue]

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.157
They’re all yours.

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:05.559
[staffs] Yes, sir.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.767
Shall we get a beer?

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:16.537
Excuse me?

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.972
Isn’t it a bit early?

00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:21.175
Don’t be shy, young man.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.879
That’s too far!

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:27.981
Come and sit over here.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.964
Let’s pass this one.

00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:48.936
But, that’s the most important
bill.

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:52.039
All bills are important.

00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:55.442
Instead,
I’ll let you have this one..

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:57.477
the revised Civil Service Law.

00:07:57.544 --> 00:07:59.980
We can’t be sloppy with these.

00:08:00.047 --> 00:08:01.582
It’s urgent, son.

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:03.951
We gotta make decisions fast

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:05.485
so that people can
get on with their lives.

00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:08.622
Will you stop calling me “son”?

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:11.491
You know how many times
I changed your dirty diapers?

00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:14.294
All right, all right.
Let’s move on.

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:15.529
[Jeong-ho laughs]

00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:18.031
You have always
been so illogical.

00:08:18.098 --> 00:08:19.800
[chuckling]

00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:28.842
[door closes]

00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:30.143
[Jeong-ho groans]

00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:36.884
E-yeon is coming back
from school this year.

00:08:43.457 --> 00:08:44.525
[Ji-wook] Yeah?

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.127
So, what?

00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:49.396
Just letting you know.

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:54.534
She’s well over thirty
and still studying?

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:55.636
[Jeong-ho grunts]

00:08:58.539 --> 00:08:59.873
Doesn’t she have plans
to get married?

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:02.276
That’s what I’m talking about.

00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:05.612
[grunts]

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.382
You dated her back in college,
didn’t you?

00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:11.618
[sighs]

00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:14.621
Says who?!

00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:18.158
Are you trying to scare me
with a stare?

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:19.626
[shouts] Guard!

00:09:19.693 --> 00:09:22.029
Did she say that?
That I dated her?

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:23.830
Your father did!

00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:25.666
That you were chasing after her.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.501
[yelling]
That’s just ridiculous!

00:09:27.968 --> 00:09:30.604
Study was my only focus.

00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:34.842
I can get the NIS
to look into it.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:35.709
Don’t lie to me.

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:37.644
[chuckles] I can’t believe this.

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.147
You would use
the agency’s service

00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:41.315
for personal reasons?

00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:43.283
Do you know what
year we’re living in?

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:45.519
That would call for impeachment.

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:47.054
Hey. This one..

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.889
the Capital Administration Bill.

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:49.990
Let me have it.

00:09:50.057 --> 00:09:51.592
[yelling] What do you mean
let you have it?!

00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:53.894
I shouldn’t have come by myself.

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:01.502
[groans]

00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:07.975
The meeting..

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.244
[cameras clicking]

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.745
It went very well.

00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:18.785
Although we didn’t manage to
go over all outstanding bills.

00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:21.889
[exhales]

00:10:23.557 --> 00:10:25.359
But, we had umm..

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.061
better results than
initially anticipated.

00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:33.367
[grunts] I’m a little exhausted

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:36.770
from the marathon meeting.

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:46.246
[man on TV] Forgive me for
telling you this in a letter.

00:10:46.313 --> 00:10:49.483
Honey, come and watch this

00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:53.320
Mimi dies tonight.

00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:56.590
They still don’t know that
they have the same father?

00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:59.927
They know now.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.461
[man on TV continues]
found out why my family

00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:04.031
disapproved of us so ardently.

00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:09.903
[host on TV] Hello everyone!

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.840
I’m your host of
tonight’s draw, Lucky Bae!

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.776
We’re coming to you live

00:11:15.843 --> 00:11:17.678
with the first draw
of the World Cup Lottery..

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:20.514
Has the battery run out?

00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:23.183
We’ll start the
draw right away.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.251

I think it’s best for you
to take a few more days off.

00:20:36.003 --> 00:20:37.838
This might be too much
of a strain right now.

00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:40.140
There’s no need
to clear the schedule.

00:20:40.207 --> 00:20:43.710

00:21:05.232 --> 00:21:07.634

But, you’ll be provided
with another vehicle.

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.405

00:25:41.708 --> 00:25:43.744
Is that so hard, old man?

00:25:43.844 --> 00:25:47.281
[yelling] How dare you
talk to me like that?

00:25:47.714 --> 00:25:49.917
I won the lottery and.
I’m here to collect my money!

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.553
What do you take me for, brat!

00:25:52.619 --> 00:25:54.788
Don’t you know who I am?

00:25:54.855 --> 00:25:57.157
Don’t you yell at me!

00:25:57.224 --> 00:25:59.660
Hey, old man! Suppose..

00:25:59.726 --> 00:26:03.063
[yelling] Even if you were
the President of this country.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.265
You still gotta
take a number slip

00:26:05.332 --> 00:26:07.566
and wait for your turn!

00:26:07.734 --> 00:26:09.803
Wait to be called for service..

00:26:10.037 --> 00:26:12.973
Sweet mother of Jesus!!

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.842
Mr. President!

00:26:16.443 --> 00:26:19.012
[yelling] Mr. President has
won the lottery!

00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:20.514
Manager, bring out his money!

00:26:20.581 --> 00:26:21.248
[manager] Yes, sir!

00:26:21.315 --> 00:26:23.750
Security, escort him, now!

00:26:23.817 --> 00:26:28.355
Everyone, Mr. President
has won the lottery!

00:26:31.525 --> 00:26:34.895
[panting]

00:26:36.663 --> 00:26:38.498
No, no..

00:26:39.266 --> 00:26:41.201
I can’t go there myself.

00:26:42.536 --> 00:26:43.637
[sighs]

00:26:43.904 --> 00:26:46.807
Everybody knows who she is.

00:26:51.278 --> 00:26:52.312
[screams]

00:26:57.317 --> 00:26:58.418
[sighing]

00:27:01.154 --> 00:27:03.457
Should I send
the Chief of Staff?

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.093
[man speaking]

00:27:06.326 --> 00:27:07.961
No, he’ll do a runner,

00:27:09.096 --> 00:27:11.565
the moment he
collects the money.

00:27:11.732 --> 00:27:16.336
[suspense music plays]

00:27:20.407 --> 00:27:21.675
[exhales]

00:27:22.609 --> 00:27:24.511
[footsteps approaching]

00:27:24.678 --> 00:27:27.915
[man mumbling]

00:27:33.654 --> 00:27:35.622
What are you stressing about?

00:27:35.689 --> 00:27:38.759
It’s not a crime for a President
to win the lottery!

00:27:39.092 --> 00:27:40.160
You’re a citizen
the same as anyone else.

00:27:41.128 --> 00:27:42.029
I am, right?

00:27:42.095 --> 00:27:44.431
You said you’d donate it all
to a good cause.

00:27:44.498 --> 00:27:46.166
You gave your word.

00:27:47.034 --> 00:27:48.735
It’s always the mouth!

00:27:48.802 --> 00:27:50.838
You can always take it back.

00:27:51.471 --> 00:27:54.007
It’s natural for a politician
to change his mind.

00:27:54.975 --> 00:27:56.043
You have a point.

00:27:56.577 --> 00:27:58.045
Everything you stood for

00:27:58.111 --> 00:28:00.280
and the integrity
of your government

00:28:00.347 --> 00:28:01.715
will go down the drain.

00:28:02.082 --> 00:28:03.383
Give up the money.

00:28:03.851 --> 00:28:05.719
But, it’s 24 billion Won.

00:28:06.253 --> 00:28:07.087
[gasps]

00:28:07.955 --> 00:28:09.423
20-what?

00:28:11.458 --> 00:28:14.061
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

00:28:14.428 --> 00:28:16.363
What’s there to think about?

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.099
Just eat dirt
and take the money!

00:28:19.199 --> 00:28:23.036
24 billion? Man..
I had no idea!

00:28:34.715 --> 00:28:35.883
Staying up late?

00:28:38.352 --> 00:28:40.287
I’ll sleep on the plane
tomorrow.

00:28:40.754 --> 00:28:43.957
You have to go back so soon?

00:28:45.292 --> 00:28:47.227
I’ll be back for good,
next year.

00:28:48.795 --> 00:28:50.097
Is there anything you need?

00:28:50.964 --> 00:28:52.466
Are you short of money?

00:28:53.333 --> 00:28:54.034
[sighs]

00:28:54.134 --> 00:28:58.038
The collapse must have
hurt you somehow.

00:28:58.205 --> 00:28:59.540
[chuckles]

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.109
Is it funny
that I talk about money?

00:29:06.046 --> 00:29:07.548
Can I take this?

00:29:08.482 --> 00:29:10.484
It’s my favorite picture.

00:29:11.351 --> 00:29:13.453
It was the hard times.

00:29:14.388 --> 00:29:17.524
I was constantly on the run

00:29:18.025 --> 00:29:20.294
or imprisoned for
political reasons.

00:29:21.495 --> 00:29:23.997
I was never able
to pay your tuition.

00:29:24.498 --> 00:29:27.935
You were always an easy target.

00:29:29.136 --> 00:29:31.405
Ji-wook’s father
never got caught

00:29:31.471 --> 00:29:32.940
even if he was
with you all the time.

00:29:33.774 --> 00:29:37.211
That’s because he backed out
at all the critical moments.

00:29:37.878 --> 00:29:39.680
[laughs]

00:29:41.114 --> 00:29:42.549
On the day I arrived.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.252
I saw Ji-wook at the hospital.

00:29:47.287 --> 00:29:49.189
He hasn’t changed a bit.

00:29:49.256 --> 00:29:53.627
He is just as stubborn
as his old man.

00:29:53.694 --> 00:29:54.895
Do you want to see him?

00:29:54.962 --> 00:29:55.794
Pardon?

00:29:56.463 --> 00:29:58.365
No, why would I?

00:29:58.498 --> 00:30:00.100
I’ll get some sleep.

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:10.744
[sighs]

00:30:11.378 --> 00:30:14.848
[kitchen staffs] You boys are
dead ‘cuz this round is mine!

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.385
[kitchen staffs gasp]

00:30:19.987 --> 00:30:21.889
Don’t mind me and go ahead.

00:30:23.056 --> 00:30:25.092
Chef Jang, do we have some soju?

00:30:25.526 --> 00:30:28.362
I’m not sure if it’s okay
to drink, sir.

00:30:28.896 --> 00:30:31.265
You only just got
out of the hospital.

00:30:32.032 --> 00:30:33.500
Have a drink.

00:30:34.468 --> 00:30:36.637
No, sir..
Thank you.

00:30:37.971 --> 00:30:39.339
[grunts]

00:30:41.842 --> 00:30:43.377
Who was winning?

00:30:43.443 --> 00:30:44.811
No one..

00:30:44.878 --> 00:30:50.884
We were just playing
to kill time

00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:54.321
but I was about to win big
when you came in.

00:30:55.656 --> 00:30:57.057
It was a double round.

00:30:57.524 --> 00:30:59.059
I don’t know the rules.

00:30:59.893 --> 00:31:02.062
Of course!

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.766
Looking back at life,

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.769
I’ve never had fun.

00:31:08.836 --> 00:31:12.539
Why would you
think that? [laughs]

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:20.514
Suppose, one day,

00:31:20.781 --> 00:31:23.550
a ton of money fell out of sky.

00:31:24.718 --> 00:31:25.786
Pardon?

00:31:26.453 --> 00:31:28.622
Say, while you’re going your way

00:31:28.689 --> 00:31:32.459
about 20 billion Won fell on you
from out of nowhere

00:31:32.926 --> 00:31:35.696
and no one knows about it
because it was a quiet alley.

00:31:35.762 --> 00:31:37.331
What would you do?

00:31:38.732 --> 00:31:40.167
Hmm..

00:31:41.068 --> 00:31:44.004
If that much money fell on me
I would die.

00:31:44.838 --> 00:31:45.472
What?

00:31:45.539 --> 00:31:50.110
If that sort of money
fell on me from the sky

00:31:50.177 --> 00:31:54.348
it would break my neck
the moment it hit.

00:31:54.748 --> 00:31:57.050
It would kill most
people on the spot.

00:31:57.084 --> 00:31:59.052
Even if you survived..

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.723
there’s no one
around to help you.

00:32:03.323 --> 00:32:05.025
So, you’d probably die

00:32:05.092 --> 00:32:06.660
after a few painful minutes.

00:32:10.564 --> 00:32:11.765
[chuckles]

00:32:11.932 --> 00:32:14.401
You’re right.
That’s what would happen.

00:32:15.068 --> 00:32:16.870
If money fell on
you from the sky.

00:32:16.937 --> 00:32:18.372
You’d die without
getting any help.

00:32:18.438 --> 00:32:20.641
Because there is no one around.

00:32:20.707 --> 00:32:22.276
That’s the right answer.

00:32:22.342 --> 00:32:24.711
“You die”. [laughs]

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.251
[Jeong-ho] Therefore,

00:32:31.318 --> 00:32:34.855
it is our duty and privilege

00:32:35.255 --> 00:32:37.090
to keep with the proud

00:32:37.157 --> 00:32:40.394
and noble beliefs of
the patriotic martyrs.

00:32:42.095 --> 00:32:47.935
I sincerely ask you to

00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:51.338
understand and approve

00:32:51.405 --> 00:32:54.575
the decision that I

00:32:54.641 --> 00:32:57.511
and this government have made

00:32:58.011 --> 00:33:02.816
regarding the Independences Day
special pardons

00:33:02.883 --> 00:33:07.287
of the two former Presidents.

00:33:07.654 --> 00:33:12.392
[Jeung-ho on TV] We must end
the vicious circle of conflict

00:33:12.459 --> 00:33:16.230
rooted in political and
geographical differences.

00:33:17.297 --> 00:33:19.166
We must unite in peace and

00:33:19.233 --> 00:33:21.401
work together for
a better tomorrow.

00:33:22.035 --> 00:33:25.439
I believe today’s
decision will mark

00:33:25.506 --> 00:33:28.509
the beginning of a
triumphant new chapter.

00:33:29.076 --> 00:33:33.747
[all clapping]

00:33:34.147 --> 00:33:37.217
That was the end of the speech
I prepared for today.

00:33:37.284 --> 00:33:43.323
But, I have another short
announcement to make.

00:33:45.025 --> 00:33:45.859
Remain in positions.

00:33:45.926 --> 00:33:50.130
Not long ago, there was a launch
of a new sports lottery.

00:33:51.098 --> 00:33:54.835
Everyone at the event
including myself,

00:33:54.902 --> 00:33:57.404
took part by entering.

00:33:58.739 --> 00:34:02.476
This isn’t part of a
report on operations.

00:34:03.477 --> 00:34:05.712
But, I’ll make an
honest confession

00:34:05.779 --> 00:34:07.814
before you all today.

00:34:09.016 --> 00:34:12.252
I won the jackpot.

00:34:12.352 --> 00:34:17.124
[suspense music plays]

00:34:21.962 --> 00:34:25.632
The winning numbers.

00:34:26.033 --> 00:34:28.068
6, 8, 0, 2, 1, 9.

00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:33.207
It’s the date I
proposed to my wife.

00:34:33.373 --> 00:34:37.644
[music continues]

00:34:38.745 --> 00:34:41.048
The jackpot amount is
24,4 billion Won.

00:34:44.685 --> 00:34:47.588
24.4 billion.

00:34:48.555 --> 00:34:51.592
It’s the kind of money that
I would never even dream about.

00:34:53.594 --> 00:34:55.696
I’ve decided to
donate the prize money

00:34:56.864 --> 00:34:59.700
to a scholarship foundation

00:34:59.766 --> 00:35:01.602
to help less fortunate
youngsters

00:35:01.668 --> 00:35:03.971
with their studies.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.709
I’ve never lived as a rich man.

00:35:09.276 --> 00:35:12.679
So, I lack ideas as to how
to spend this money wisely.

00:35:14.314 --> 00:35:15.549
If my decision,

00:35:16.116 --> 00:35:20.187
which I believe
to be the only right one,

00:35:20.254 --> 00:35:24.291
can help young people
build their dreams,

00:35:24.758 --> 00:35:27.227
It’ll be my greatest joy.

00:35:28.128 --> 00:35:30.264
And, if I may add..

00:35:31.064 --> 00:35:34.234
If there is anyone
among my predecessors

00:35:34.301 --> 00:35:38.939
who has money that doesn’t
rightly belong to them.

00:35:39.006 --> 00:35:41.608
How about spending it
on a good cause?

00:35:42.042 --> 00:35:45.145
Just my thought.

00:35:45.746 --> 00:35:50.484
[audience clapping]

00:36:12.206 --> 00:36:16.109
I’m sorry I didn’t
tell you earlier.

00:36:16.176 --> 00:36:17.744
Have you lost your mind?

00:36:18.445 --> 00:36:19.446
Huh?

00:36:19.546 --> 00:36:23.083
I mean that money..
Good Gracious!

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:28.055
Couldn’t you have
kept a half, at least?

00:36:28.121 --> 00:36:30.457
I’m at a loss for words!

00:36:30.524 --> 00:36:33.427
-Honey, I..
-Forget it!

00:36:33.493 --> 00:36:38.232
And, you proposed to me
in March, not February.

00:36:39.166 --> 00:36:42.536
Was it? I’m sure
it was February.

00:36:42.603 --> 00:36:44.538
Have you ever seen
cherry blossoms in February?

00:36:47.241 --> 00:36:48.475
[grunts]

00:36:48.742 --> 00:36:50.377
You’re right.

00:36:50.444 --> 00:36:52.813
It was during the
blossom season.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.249
So, it was March.

00:36:55.782 --> 00:36:56.617
[Jeong-ho's wife scoffs]

00:36:57.751 --> 00:36:58.852
Honey, should I recant and

00:36:58.919 --> 00:37:02.022
say that I want to
keep the money?

00:37:02.055 --> 00:37:04.091
And, be a national
laughing stock?

00:37:04.157 --> 00:37:05.826
[Jeung-ho] I could say.

00:37:05.893 --> 00:37:07.995
I’ll keep the money
and give up the pension.

00:37:08.061 --> 00:37:10.330
[Jeung-ho's wife] Can you
not talk for a moment,

00:37:10.397 --> 00:37:11.331
Mr. President?

00:37:12.332 --> 00:37:13.901
[engines reviving]

00:37:14.368 --> 00:37:16.170
[engines reviving]

00:37:22.342 --> 00:37:24.545
[clapping]

00:37:27.347 --> 00:37:30.751
[ceremonial music plays]

00:37:30.851 --> 00:37:36.823
I do solemnly swear that
I will faithfully execute

00:37:37.624 --> 00:37:41.995
the Office of President
of the Republic of Korea

00:37:42.062 --> 00:37:44.031
and will to the best
of my ability,

00:37:44.097 --> 00:37:45.966
preserve, protect and defend

00:37:46.033 --> 00:37:49.236
the Constitution of
the Republic of Korea.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:52.940
President of Republic of Korea,
Cha Ji-wook.

00:37:53.173 --> 00:37:57.244
[suspense music plays]

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.695
[Ji-wook]
When did it start exactly?

00:38:15.562 --> 00:38:17.497
[staff] The initial detection
was made at 21:00

00:38:17.564 --> 00:38:18.765
by the Combined Forces Command

00:38:18.832 --> 00:38:21.635
and we received
the report at 23:05.

00:38:22.836 --> 00:38:24.304
[Ji-wook]
How come we are the last to know

00:38:24.371 --> 00:38:26.573
about tensions taking
place in our waters.

00:38:28.542 --> 00:38:33.514
Maritime command is still in the
hands of Pacific Command, sir.

00:38:34.915 --> 00:38:37.918
[woman] Mr. President, it’s
the White House.

00:38:42.656 --> 00:38:43.924
Any chance they’ll give us time?

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:47.828
Very slim, sir.

00:38:49.396 --> 00:38:50.430
Not even a little?

00:38:57.237 --> 00:38:58.272
[man] We’re connected, sir.

00:38:59.873 --> 00:39:01.742
[speaking English]
Good morning Mr. President.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.679
[speaking Korean] I’m sorry
but it’s nighttime, here.

00:39:05.746 --> 00:39:09.516
[in English] Shit! I forgot.

00:39:10.217 --> 00:39:12.319
[in Korean]
I just received the report.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.556
Of course, hours later than you.

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:20.093
[in English] We will be
having an NSA meeting

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.696
in a few hours and of course

00:39:22.763 --> 00:39:26.066
our conclusion will be
reacting strongly against it.

00:39:27.634 --> 00:39:31.572
If congress approves, we
will be moving our 7th fleet.

00:39:33.941 --> 00:39:38.245
[in Korean] Shouldn’t we think
about the cause first?

00:39:39.847 --> 00:39:40.881
[in English] Pardon?

00:39:41.748 --> 00:39:43.784
[in Korean] Japan has moved
their missile base

00:39:43.851 --> 00:39:46.553
to the Northwest to
protect the trajectory.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.688
[translator speaking]

00:39:47.754 --> 00:39:49.523
[Ji-wook in Korean]
And in the name of training,

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:51.358
they have focused
their Maritime Force

00:39:51.425 --> 00:39:53.360
on North Korea and
in our territorial waters.

00:39:54.127 --> 00:39:58.065
As you know,
without prior consent

00:39:58.131 --> 00:39:59.800
from the concerning countries

00:40:01.168 --> 00:40:02.102
a military activity of this kind

00:40:02.169 --> 00:40:04.171
can be deemed an act
of provocation.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.709
Japan would’ve
anticipated this reaction.

00:40:09.943 --> 00:40:12.346
Don’t you think
it’s weird that Japan

00:40:13.747 --> 00:40:15.782
is knowingly creating tension?

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:17.885
[woman in English]
We don't have time

00:40:17.951 --> 00:40:19.920
to think about such
thing, Mr. President.

00:40:21.989 --> 00:40:24.958
[suspense music plays]

00:40:26.493 --> 00:40:28.695
[in English]
This is not a political plan

00:40:28.762 --> 00:40:31.164
but a military conflict.

00:40:31.798 --> 00:40:34.935
by all means, when
congress approves,

00:40:35.002 --> 00:40:38.839
the Republic of Korea will
have to open up both air space

00:40:38.906 --> 00:40:41.141
and its territorial waters..

00:40:42.342 --> 00:40:44.044
According to the plan..

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:50.717
[suspense music continues]

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.855
[in Korean]
If the Pacific Command

00:40:54.922 --> 00:40:55.989
enters our air and waters,

00:40:57.157 --> 00:41:01.361
then, so will the Japanese.
Self-Defense Force, right?

00:41:03.463 --> 00:41:05.966
[in English]
Be rational about this..

00:41:10.304 --> 00:41:15.409
[suspense music heightens]

00:41:22.082 --> 00:41:23.750
[in Korean]
Give us til the end of the week.

00:41:23.851 --> 00:41:25.519
[translator speaking

00:41:27.955 --> 00:41:32.059

PRESIDENT’S HARD-LINE
FOREIGN POLICY.

00:41:37.931 --> 00:41:40.868
[man coughs]

00:41:41.568 --> 00:41:45.205
TENSION COULD LEAD TO WAR?

00:41:51.478 --> 00:41:53.447
[coughing continues]

00:42:03.891 --> 00:42:06.960
[man] We demanded the Japanese
clear out

00:42:07.027 --> 00:42:08.362
by an official letter.

00:42:08.428 --> 00:42:10.464
In a worst case scenario,

00:42:10.531 --> 00:42:12.432
you should be prepared
to get China involved.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.502
The simplest solution would be
to convince North Korea.

00:42:16.236 --> 00:42:17.304
If they withdraw,

00:42:17.371 --> 00:42:18.972
we can untangle this problem.

00:42:19.473 --> 00:42:20.941
A more urgent issue at hand

00:42:21.008 --> 00:42:23.043
is the upcoming
general election.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.112
You should really
pay more attention.

00:42:26.213 --> 00:42:27.181
Approval ratings dropped again?

00:42:28.615 --> 00:42:29.416
Water, please?

00:42:30.617 --> 00:42:32.286
[Moon] Diplomatic tension
with Japan

00:42:32.953 --> 00:42:35.255
is creating unrest
among the public.

00:42:36.156 --> 00:42:37.291
And, the party is grieving about

00:42:37.691 --> 00:42:39.526
the lack of support
on your part.

00:42:41.094 --> 00:42:41.995
So..?

00:42:42.396 --> 00:42:44.398
Are you asking me
to put on a show

00:42:44.464 --> 00:42:47.935
or something for ratings?

00:42:53.574 --> 00:42:55.242
You should take this seriously.

00:42:56.543 --> 00:42:57.644
Things are not looking good.

00:42:58.879 --> 00:43:00.647
We cannot afford to lose

00:43:00.714 --> 00:43:02.580
to the Opposition.

00:43:07.688 --> 00:43:08.689
[sighs]

00:43:10.891 --> 00:43:12.593
What do I have to do
to get some water here?!

00:43:14.695 --> 00:43:15.696
[hushing]

00:43:17.397 --> 00:43:19.399
We have a meeting with
the Japanese Ambassador.

00:43:23.136 --> 00:43:27.140
[fast music plays]

00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:29.009
[ambassador speaking Korean]
We are.. very regretful that

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:30.944
the Korean government..

00:43:31.011 --> 00:43:35.782
isn’t actively
dealing with the recent episode..

00:43:35.849 --> 00:43:40.187
of provocation by
the North Korean military.

00:43:41.688 --> 00:43:42.456
[sighs]

00:43:44.491 --> 00:43:47.461
[Ji-wook]
You seem to be mistaken.

00:43:47.628 --> 00:43:49.696
[translator speaking
in Japanese]

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:52.266
I have summoned you here,
Ambassador!

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.602
Not for your opinion
or a chit-chat,

00:43:58.405 --> 00:44:00.440
but to tell you that
the current tensions

00:44:00.507 --> 00:44:03.177
were triggered by
Japan’s military action.

00:44:03.544 --> 00:44:04.244
Do you understand?

00:44:05.345 --> 00:44:07.047
[speaking Korean]
But, it’s a.. legitimate..

00:44:07.114 --> 00:44:11.585
Please speak in Japanese.
You have a translator.

00:44:11.652 --> 00:44:13.220
Wouldn’t it be easier?

00:44:13.287 --> 00:44:15.122
Why sweat it?

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:20.761
-Just speak in Japanese.
-Should I go home?

00:44:23.363 --> 00:44:24.765
[in Japanese] I’m sorry.

00:44:26.366 --> 00:44:27.267
[clears throat]

00:44:27.334 --> 00:44:32.940
[speaking Japanese]

00:44:33.006 --> 00:44:34.708
[Ji-wook] Take a seat.

00:44:34.775 --> 00:44:36.343
[ambassador speaking Japanese]
This training was

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:38.679
a legitimate military activity.

00:44:38.745 --> 00:44:41.381
We never violated
foreign territories

00:44:41.815 --> 00:44:42.549
[translator]
and acted under approval

00:44:42.616 --> 00:44:43.483
from the Pacific Command.

00:44:47.354 --> 00:44:50.757
Do you take me for an idiot?!

00:44:52.926 --> 00:44:53.927
[grunting]

00:44:56.396 --> 00:44:57.531
Look at me, Ambassador!

00:44:58.999 --> 00:45:01.168
The Maritime Force intruded
into our waters

00:45:01.235 --> 00:45:03.537
3 times while relocating
to the northwest

00:45:04.338 --> 00:45:06.039
and the standoff area
is conventionally

00:45:06.106 --> 00:45:07.741
prohibited from
military activities.

00:45:07.808 --> 00:45:08.709
You know that, don’t you?

00:45:09.476 --> 00:45:11.945
This is not military training
but a military action

00:45:13.347 --> 00:45:15.382
and it’s a natural reaction
for North Korea

00:45:15.582 --> 00:45:17.117
which works in favor
of your government.

00:45:17.184 --> 00:45:19.453
Because such
military tension will

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.989
raise concerns
for national security

00:45:22.422 --> 00:45:26.593
and stirred-up public sentiment
will pave the way

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.495
for legislation of the.
New National Security Law

00:45:28.562 --> 00:45:32.366
that the right wing government
always wanted. Isn’t that so?

00:45:33.667 --> 00:45:36.803
[yelling] What’s the matter?
Lost for words?

00:45:38.472 --> 00:45:40.073
[translator] I’m so sorry but
you spoke too fast..

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.808
Don’t take the Korean government
for a fool.

00:45:43.277 --> 00:45:45.179
We may have
a humiliating history

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.848
but we don’t do
humiliating politics.

00:45:50.117 --> 00:45:52.486
[speaking Japanese] We’d better
wrap it up for today.

00:45:57.925 --> 00:46:00.427
[flight attendant]
Could you put the blind up?

00:46:00.527 --> 00:46:02.760
[announcement in Chinese]

00:46:02.896 --> 00:46:04.231
Thank you!

00:46:15.642 --> 00:46:21.148
[suspense music plays]

00:46:27.387 --> 00:46:30.424

00:46:40.734 --> 00:46:44.802
[traditional music plays]

00:47:07.027 --> 00:47:08.826
It’s my second time in Seoul.

00:47:10.464 --> 00:47:12.366
The night view was spectacular

00:47:13.767 --> 00:47:17.604
with all the bright lights
on bridges and buildings.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.043
I’m flattered. Thank you.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:24.745
Why would you be?

00:47:24.811 --> 00:47:28.248
It’s not like you built them.
[laughs]

00:47:29.216 --> 00:47:31.185
North Korea must withdraw
by the end of the week.

00:47:32.252 --> 00:47:36.523
You cannot take an emotional
approach with Japan.

00:47:37.024 --> 00:47:40.627
Because that’s what they want.

00:47:41.328 --> 00:47:43.897
They want to make an issue
out of the current crisis.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:56.710
We’re telling them
to stay out of our waters

00:47:58.278 --> 00:48:02.916
telling them to stop pointing
missiles at our country.

00:48:03.584 --> 00:48:07.187
In case they’re
having wild ideas

00:48:07.254 --> 00:48:09.389
about our people again,

00:48:09.957 --> 00:48:12.092
we’re telling them
we’re pissed off

00:48:12.159 --> 00:48:13.560
and that we won’t blankly stare

00:48:14.328 --> 00:48:16.530
like the Americans
or the South Koreans.

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:21.702
Are you saying you’re
prepared to go war?

00:48:22.402 --> 00:48:23.537
Who are you?

00:48:23.604 --> 00:48:24.705
I’m the Chief of
National Intelligence.

00:48:24.771 --> 00:48:30.210
But then, when you dropped
a missile in Japanese waters

00:48:30.277 --> 00:48:32.913
or pressed on with plans
to launch satellites,

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.682
the surrounding countries
passed over in silence.

00:48:36.016 --> 00:48:39.920
Because we wanted to
prevent war, at all costs.

00:48:40.654 --> 00:48:41.989
And, you are..?

00:48:42.322 --> 00:48:43.590
I’m the Secretary
of National Security.

00:48:44.458 --> 00:48:49.530
Did you invite me over
to gang up on me?

00:48:49.596 --> 00:48:52.032
What do you mean gang up on you?

00:48:52.099 --> 00:48:52.933
Listen!

00:48:54.968 --> 00:48:56.470
It was the same
back in ’94 and ’08

00:48:57.271 --> 00:48:59.473
when the Americans
pushed us over.

00:49:00.841 --> 00:49:02.643
We have never
changed our position

00:49:03.043 --> 00:49:05.479
because we’re not Afghans

00:49:05.546 --> 00:49:07.347
playing with popguns in caves.

00:49:08.515 --> 00:49:10.951
Or some tiny banana
republic in Africa

00:49:11.018 --> 00:49:13.554
or Central America that
sprouts up and disappears.

00:49:19.026 --> 00:49:23.197
Are you scared of war,
Mr. President?

00:49:24.231 --> 00:49:28.869
[suspense music plays]

00:49:35.209 --> 00:49:37.010
There are three things
in the world

00:49:38.278 --> 00:49:39.680
that I’m scared of.

00:49:40.314 --> 00:49:43.383
First is needles.

00:49:45.052 --> 00:49:46.086
Second is

00:49:47.788 --> 00:49:50.224
when my little son
raises his hand with a question.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.561
And the last is..

00:49:56.496 --> 00:49:57.764
candlelight vigils.

00:50:01.735 --> 00:50:02.603
A War?

00:50:04.505 --> 00:50:05.739
We’ll go to war
if it’s necessary.

00:50:10.577 --> 00:50:11.945
But, now is not the time.

00:50:13.714 --> 00:50:15.482
Now, you have to trust us.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:19.219
No, trust me, Cha Ji-wook.

00:50:20.354 --> 00:50:21.989
I’ll prove to you

00:50:22.656 --> 00:50:24.525
that a solid government
and good politicians

00:50:25.292 --> 00:50:26.560
are stronger than
a million troops.

00:50:30.631 --> 00:50:33.233
[woman on TV] My
beloved people of Korea..

00:50:33.901 --> 00:50:36.970
Han Kyung-ja, the former
Minister of Law.

00:50:37.304 --> 00:50:38.338
She’s a good card.

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:43.810
She could be a breath
of fresh air temporarily.

00:50:45.679 --> 00:50:48.515
But, are we ready
for a female president?

00:50:48.582 --> 00:50:51.285
A publicity stunt for
the election, clearly.

00:50:51.885 --> 00:50:52.819
You think so?

00:50:55.489 --> 00:50:57.357
Why am I going to the market?

00:50:58.358 --> 00:51:00.794
To get a sense
of public sentiment.

00:51:01.228 --> 00:51:03.697
[Kyung-ja on TV]
I would like to thank

00:51:03.764 --> 00:51:07.601
my fellow candidates.

00:51:08.902 --> 00:51:10.003
Hang on..

00:51:10.871 --> 00:51:12.372
That woman there..

00:51:14.708 --> 00:51:15.309
It’s Professor Kim E-yeon,

00:51:15.375 --> 00:51:17.010
daughter of the
former President Kim.

00:51:17.411 --> 00:51:19.580
She was scouted as
the counsel for foreign policy.

00:51:20.047 --> 00:51:22.983
They seem to be a good match.

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:25.352
Do you know her?

00:51:26.386 --> 00:51:29.323
What? Not really..

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:33.090
Our fathers were friends.

00:51:33.994 --> 00:51:35.896
[staff] She could have come on
the scene earlier.

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:40.000
But, she kept a low profile
until her father’s term ended.

00:51:41.101 --> 00:51:42.870
Smart.. really.

00:51:43.704 --> 00:51:45.405
She’s also the spokesperson.

00:51:45.906 --> 00:51:46.840
Really?

00:51:50.277 --> 00:51:52.980
Well, anything sounds better
when it comes out of a beauty.

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.048
But, too hasty.

[woman staff scoffs]

00:52:08.695 --> 00:52:10.097
Shouldn’t we send

00:52:12.266 --> 00:52:15.402
some congratulatory
flowers for Ms. Han?

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:17.604
I already have, sir.

00:52:18.539 --> 00:52:20.507
Good for you.

00:52:25.512 --> 00:52:27.748
Do you think I should
send something

00:52:27.814 --> 00:52:28.782
for Professor Kim, too?

00:52:28.815 --> 00:52:29.816
What do you think?

00:52:32.619 --> 00:52:33.787
I have that arranged, too.

00:53:26.473 --> 00:53:28.108
Is this really necessary?

00:53:29.877 --> 00:53:32.346
It’s the easiest and surest way.
You believe what you see.

00:53:32.412 --> 00:53:33.947
I should be making policy
for people.

00:53:35.649 --> 00:53:41.688
Eating rice cake in the market
won’t make any changes.

00:53:45.459 --> 00:53:46.660
Rice cake?

00:53:48.862 --> 00:53:49.963
That’s a good idea.

00:53:51.131 --> 00:53:52.833
Why didn’t I think of that?

Rice cake..

00:53:57.104 --> 00:53:59.139
and, throw in some
fish balls and sausages.

00:54:00.607 --> 00:54:02.809
It’ll make it all
the more realistic

00:54:02.843 --> 00:54:03.977

The events of this afternoon

00:56:10.838 --> 00:56:13.607
is an example of
the misguided belief

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.375
widely spread in our society

00:56:15.442 --> 00:56:17.711
that things can be
achieved with a loud voice.

00:56:17.744 --> 00:56:19.780
[newscaster] Foreign press
have reported today’s incident

00:56:19.813 --> 00:56:24.818
as an act of a
mentally deranged man.

The President was safe however

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.056
and according to the
police Investigation,

00:56:29.156 --> 00:56:30.824
the young man is 22 years old..

00:56:30.858 --> 00:56:32.826
[woman] According to
eyewitness accounts,

00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:35.796
the President threw
himself to the ground

00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:38.866
before his guards
surrounded him.

00:56:38.899 --> 00:56:40.801
If what the attacker
pulled out of

00:56:40.868 --> 00:56:43.904
his jacket was not
a banner but a gun,

00:56:43.937 --> 00:56:45.506
we could have lost

00:56:45.572 --> 00:56:48.308

President in history.

Don’t say that, sir.

Regarding today’s incident,

wrap it up as swiftly
as possible.

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:19.206
A reprimand of some sort for
security will be unavoidable.

00:57:19.573 --> 00:57:21.808
It’s become a bit of an issue.

00:57:21.875 --> 00:57:23.410
It’s late.

Now the entire country knows it.

A young man begged
the President to save his father

00:57:55.108 --> 00:57:57.511
and only the President
can save him.

00:57:59.313 --> 00:58:01.515

you to go through

Just the gesture.

00:58:12.259 --> 00:58:14.261
The President
was willing to help

00:58:14.328 --> 00:58:16.096
but due to medical
complications..

00:58:16.697 --> 00:58:19.266
We’ll get the message across.

could turn the situation

That’s what we learned.

I’m not here to punish you.

There’s been some drama
in my life recently.

01:00:24.725 --> 01:00:26.193

That’s okay.

01:00:56.156 --> 01:00:58.759
It’s a physiological reaction.

01:01:05.999 --> 01:01:07.868

Mr. Cha Myung-soo MP, right?

01:01:41.702 --> 01:01:43.937
Not many young people
know about him.

01:01:44.004 --> 01:01:45.702
I read his memoir..

01:01:46.573 --> 01:01:48.242
and saw a documentary
on him, too.

01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:53.080

of talk about you.

You found out
about my blood type

01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:16.136
and that I have
a rare tissue type.

01:02:17.004 --> 01:02:19.273
Yes, I learned all that
from the book.

Well, I came here to apologize.

It’s not final but matching
blood type and DNA tissue..

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:45.065
doesn’t mean I qualify
as a donor.

Also, being President
of a country..

01:02:48.769 --> 01:02:53.140
it’s not my personal decision.

01:02:53.874 --> 01:02:55.409
But, you achieved so many things

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:58.111
by fighting opposition

01:02:59.346 --> 01:03:01.815

your belief was right.

is miniscule.

By 0800 tomorrow,

a regiment from the
7th fleet will pass the East Sea

That’s right.

This is the standoff point.

small on the map?

01:05:41.542 --> 01:05:43.410
Isn’t it actually
bigger than that?

01:05:49.183 --> 01:05:50.317
I’ll correct that, sir.

01:05:54.288 --> 01:05:55.689
[sighs]

01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:07.768
If we don’t open up our waters,
what happens next?

01:06:10.037 --> 01:06:11.638
The White House will call

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:17.144
and play the wartime
command card.

01:06:18.812 --> 01:06:23.450
I’ll tell them the current
situation isn’t critical.

01:06:23.517 --> 01:06:24.785
And, then?

01:06:24.852 --> 01:06:28.488
Following more discussions..

01:06:28.555 --> 01:06:31.491
You’ll buy some time.

01:06:33.327 --> 01:06:34.561
Three days left, right?

01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:37.931
If we prove to the North Koreans

01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:40.300
that they can trust us,

01:06:40.934 --> 01:06:43.704
We must carefully weigh
the gains and losses.

01:06:45.939 --> 01:06:49.142
The American President and
the Republicans won’t be happy

01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:51.645
but we can prevent a war.

01:06:52.946 --> 01:06:54.181
Also, we can stop
the legislation of

01:06:54.314 --> 01:06:55.482
Japan’s New Self-Defense Law

01:06:55.782 --> 01:06:58.852
and improve our relationship
with the North.

01:07:01.088 --> 01:07:02.789
Much more to gain than to lose.

01:07:08.495 --> 01:07:11.965
No.. Everything is okay.

01:07:12.366 --> 01:07:14.234
What do you mean
a war will break out?

01:07:14.735 --> 01:07:17.171
Test results are already in?

01:07:18.105 --> 01:07:20.440
Couldn’t they wait
a few more days?

01:07:21.141 --> 01:07:22.543
Anything I need to know?

01:07:27.447 --> 01:07:29.550
[suspense music plays]

01:07:31.852 --> 01:07:33.020
What?!

01:07:53.407 --> 01:07:55.442
[indistinct chatter]

01:07:55.542 --> 01:07:57.077
[all gasp]

01:07:59.046 --> 01:08:00.714
FULL HOUSE

01:08:06.753 --> 01:08:08.689
I can make some noodles

01:08:08.755 --> 01:08:11.225
if you give me a few minutes.

01:08:11.558 --> 01:08:12.693
That’s okay.

01:08:13.627 --> 01:08:15.262
I felt like instant noodles.

01:08:16.129 --> 01:08:17.798
This kimchi is amazing.

01:08:18.165 --> 01:08:19.867
You made it yourself?

01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:22.970
Usually, I do.

01:08:23.036 --> 01:08:25.739
But, we ordered
ready-made this time.

01:08:28.242 --> 01:08:29.443
-Right..
-I’m sorry.

01:08:32.846 --> 01:08:33.914
My son woke up in
the middle of the night

01:08:33.981 --> 01:08:36.016
and asked me a question.

01:08:39.253 --> 01:08:42.923
He says he’s in love
with someone

01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:45.559
but doesn’t know what to do.

01:08:47.027 --> 01:08:48.595
Kids these days
are unbelievable.

01:08:49.530 --> 01:08:50.797
So, what did you tell him?

01:08:52.566 --> 01:08:54.801
So, I told him..

01:08:56.270 --> 01:08:58.438
If you really love that person

01:08:59.339 --> 01:09:00.774
love your daddy first,

01:09:01.775 --> 01:09:05.579
then, she’ll love you, too.

01:09:07.681 --> 01:09:09.283
That doesn’t make sense.

01:09:10.617 --> 01:09:13.120
It doesn’t, does it?

01:09:13.187 --> 01:09:15.756
-Use this.
-Thank you.

01:09:18.158 --> 01:09:18.959
[sighs]

01:09:23.230 --> 01:09:24.565
I don’t remember exactly

01:09:25.799 --> 01:09:29.169
but I think I had a similar
conversation with my father.

01:09:31.805 --> 01:09:34.241
If you really love someone..

01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:38.512
No, that’s not what he said.

01:09:38.579 --> 01:09:41.815
If you really want to love,
and save this country,

01:09:41.882 --> 01:09:44.351
Look after the hungry kid
next door, first.

01:09:47.487 --> 01:09:49.523
I read it in his memoir.

01:09:51.692 --> 01:09:53.727
How did I reply to that?

01:09:57.097 --> 01:09:57.965
I’m not sure

01:09:59.132 --> 01:10:00.534
but I don’t think

01:10:00.601 --> 01:10:02.603
it had what you said after,
in the book.

01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:04.238
[sighs]

01:10:06.006 --> 01:10:08.208
Look after the hungry
kid next door, first.

01:10:11.144 --> 01:10:12.112
[Ji-wook's father] One time,

01:10:12.179 --> 01:10:14.147
an old man came to me,
and asked me.

01:10:14.648 --> 01:10:16.550
If, while you were
busy running around

01:10:16.617 --> 01:10:17.784
trying to make a better country,

01:10:17.851 --> 01:10:21.822
your neighbor’s child
dies of starvation.

01:10:21.889 --> 01:10:23.857
Have you really
saved the country?

01:10:25.192 --> 01:10:26.193
You’re right.

01:10:27.261 --> 01:10:28.595
I think that’s what he said.

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:33.901
[Ji-wook's father] So, if you
really love your mum and dad,

01:10:33.967 --> 01:10:37.070
you must love a friend who’s in
a less fortunate situation.

01:10:38.172 --> 01:10:39.806
If you do, it’s same as

01:10:39.873 --> 01:10:41.141
loving your own mum and dad

01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:43.944
and loving this country.

01:10:45.445 --> 01:10:46.680
[sighs]

01:10:47.314 --> 01:10:49.016
Thank you for the ramen.

01:10:54.321 --> 01:10:55.856
Did you have to come up with

01:10:55.923 --> 01:10:57.558
the crazy idea,
at this crucial time?

01:10:57.591 --> 01:10:59.459
Look at the mess you made.

01:11:00.928 --> 01:11:04.260
The idea was to make a gesture.

01:11:05.532 --> 01:11:07.801
I honestly didn’t
expect this result.

01:11:08.335 --> 01:11:12.005
Do you know how
scared he is of needles?

01:11:12.639 --> 01:11:14.141
[man] Mr. President is here.

01:11:24.351 --> 01:11:27.354
[papers flipping]

01:11:34.361 --> 01:11:39.366
I believe this morning’s
unscheduled statement

01:11:40.167 --> 01:11:44.004
gave rise to concerns
and questions

01:11:44.071 --> 01:11:47.207
for fellow Koreans
watching this program.

01:11:48.942 --> 01:11:50.410
Early this morning,

01:11:51.144 --> 01:11:53.180
this government made a decision

01:11:53.914 --> 01:11:54.948
to turn down
the U.S.’s request

01:11:55.015 --> 01:11:55.816
for military cooperation.

01:11:57.784 --> 01:12:00.420
[on TV] The decision is
consistent with our principles

01:12:00.687 --> 01:12:04.925
of prioritizing
national security

01:12:04.992 --> 01:12:07.127
and maintaining
self-reliant peace in Asia.

01:12:08.996 --> 01:12:11.098
It is also a manifestation
of our will

01:12:11.164 --> 01:12:12.933
to solidify trust
with North Korea.

01:12:14.434 --> 01:12:16.637
Despite the grave importance
of this matter,

01:12:17.504 --> 01:12:22.338
time was of the essence
in reaching a decision

01:12:22.776 --> 01:12:26.647
which will be reviewed
by the Assembly later.

01:12:28.115 --> 01:12:31.318
Today’s decision which entails

01:12:31.385 --> 01:12:35.289
the risk of diplomatic
friction with the U.S.

01:12:35.355 --> 01:12:38.759
is a manifestation
of our concern over

01:12:38.825 --> 01:12:40.594
the military expansion of Japan.

01:12:44.431 --> 01:12:45.399
[grunts]

01:12:47.768 --> 01:12:48.869
[murmurs]

01:12:50.103 --> 01:12:52.239
I would like to ask
for your understanding

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.441
on another decision I made.

01:12:57.144 --> 01:13:01.315
Two days ago, a young man
came to me to save his father.

01:13:03.584 --> 01:13:04.818
[Ji-wook on TV] He believed

01:13:04.918 --> 01:13:06.954
that only I could
save the life of his father

01:13:09.156 --> 01:13:11.358
and that wasn’t
far from the truth.

01:13:13.594 --> 01:13:14.995
I would like to announce to

01:13:15.062 --> 01:13:16.964
my fellow Koreans
and my loyal staff,

01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:19.466
a decision I believe
to be the best

01:13:19.533 --> 01:13:20.901
I could reach has been made.

01:13:21.735 --> 01:13:23.737
In a few hours,

01:13:23.804 --> 01:13:28.976
I will undergo an operation to
transplant one of my kidneys

01:13:34.448 --> 01:13:35.649
to the man who shares

01:13:35.716 --> 01:13:38.285
the same rare tissue
structure as me,

01:13:38.385 --> 01:13:40.754
who is teetering
on the verge of life and death.

01:13:43.190 --> 01:13:44.958
During the six-hour operation

01:13:45.893 --> 01:13:48.595
and the following
few days of recovery,

01:13:50.564 --> 01:13:52.199
the entire cabinet
will do their best

01:13:52.266 --> 01:13:55.169
to ensure the smooth
running of state affairs.

01:13:57.738 --> 01:14:00.007
It is my belief
that if I can’t save

01:14:00.073 --> 01:14:02.509
the life of one man
who needs my help,

01:14:04.111 --> 01:14:11.552

Will I need general anesthesia,
for the procedure?

01:14:29.736 --> 01:14:31.471
How is it done?

01:14:32.739 --> 01:14:35.509

Why do you like her?

How did it go?

01:17:30.751 --> 01:17:33.487
The North Koreans
withdrew their troops

01:17:33.554 --> 01:17:38.959
and, agreed to accept our terms
of negotiation with Japan.

No,

absurd, of course!

But then, if you
gave away that, too.

[man protesting] He can do it
for one man but not for me?

01:20:51.518 --> 01:20:53.487
[woman]
It’s the moment of truth.

01:20:53.554 --> 01:20:56.390
“The choice of the Nation”.
At a 95% confidence level,

01:20:56.456 --> 01:20:59.092
and a sampling error
of plus or minus 1%

01:20:59.159 --> 01:21:03.163
we give you
the exit poll results.

01:21:03.564 --> 01:21:05.899
EXIT POLL RESULTS

01:21:06.166 --> 01:21:08.969
[cameras clicking]

01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:12.206
[woman] With 58.3% of the vote,

01:21:12.272 --> 01:21:16.877
Han Kyung-ja of United Democrats
is likely to secure a victory.

01:21:17.578 --> 01:21:23.050
[man] Han Kyung-ja of United
Democrats won 14,350,000 votes

01:21:23.150 --> 01:21:25.319
out of the 25,100,000 cast,

01:21:25.385 --> 01:21:28.889
taking 57.1% of the total votes.

01:21:28.956 --> 01:21:30.490
[woman] Women’s interest groups

01:21:30.557 --> 01:21:32.426
welcomed the result
with excitement

01:21:32.492 --> 01:21:34.995
and resolution for change.

01:21:35.062 --> 01:21:35.863
[man] Presidential elect Han

01:21:35.929 --> 01:21:36.897
promised to rein in
property speculation,

01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:39.066
and push for tax and
educational reform

01:21:39.132 --> 01:21:40.601
from the beginning
of her campaign.

01:21:40.934 --> 01:21:43.904
[dance teacher]
Two three.. and.

01:21:44.137 --> 01:21:46.902
One two three,

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:52.646
One two three, one two three..

01:21:53.046 --> 01:21:55.749
one two three..

01:21:55.816 --> 01:21:58.652
[Chang-myun] Is this really
necessary for your birthday?

01:21:58.719 --> 01:22:00.587
[Kyung-ja] It’s useful to know
how to dance.

01:22:00.654 --> 01:22:02.356
You’ll need it for
foreign guests.

01:22:02.956 --> 01:22:04.920
[Chang-myun] Hey, what’s on
the schedule today?

01:22:06.326 --> 01:22:09.696
You have a visit to an orphanage
called Home of Love

01:22:09.763 --> 01:22:12.933
and a rally commemorating.
“Housewives’ Day”.

01:22:14.635 --> 01:22:15.802
[sighing]

01:22:18.539 --> 01:22:23.110
No, I mean my wife’s schedule.

01:22:23.677 --> 01:22:25.913
And, why do I have to attend
a “Housewives’ Day” event?

01:22:25.979 --> 01:22:26.813
[staff] Well..

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:30.884
Can you not refer to me
as “wife” in public?

01:22:31.251 --> 01:22:33.587
It’s been over a year now.
Is it still so difficult?

01:22:34.321 --> 01:22:36.757
Well, you’re not my husband.

01:22:37.357 --> 01:22:40.956
[waltz music plays]

01:22:41.895 --> 01:22:43.263
Let’s talk about that later.

01:22:43.864 --> 01:22:45.866
Shall we wrap up for today?

01:22:45.933 --> 01:22:46.834
Yes, ma’am.

01:22:52.272 --> 01:22:53.006
[door closes]

01:22:55.242 --> 01:23:00.447
[man] It would be safe to assume
that the eco-system issue

01:23:00.514 --> 01:23:04.551
is cleared for “Area A”.

01:23:04.618 --> 01:23:11.024
[women singing] I’d rather
be the scent of a flower

01:23:11.091 --> 01:23:17.431
than the flower itself.

01:23:18.265 --> 01:23:23.804
[Chang-myun join singing]
A scent called a housewife.

01:23:25.606 --> 01:23:32.079
[all] A scent that makes
a flower more beautiful

01:23:32.412 --> 01:23:34.815
[singing continues]

01:23:35.082 --> 01:23:39.119
[phone rings]

01:23:42.356 --> 01:23:45.926
[continue ringing]

01:23:48.695 --> 01:23:50.097
Is that you, dog-face?

01:23:50.163 --> 01:23:51.532
Yeah, I can talk now..

01:23:52.766 --> 01:23:53.667
Really?

01:23:54.034 --> 01:23:55.302
Was it tomorrow?

01:23:56.236 --> 01:23:58.605
Hang on.. let me check
my schedule.

01:23:59.773 --> 01:24:03.610
I have something
but I’ll definitely come by.

01:24:03.677 --> 01:24:06.747
Is “Jellyfish” and “Optimus
Prime” coming, too?

01:24:08.148 --> 01:24:10.484
Great! I’ll be there.

01:24:11.151 --> 01:24:13.654
We’ve got to see each other
when we still can.

01:24:14.388 --> 01:24:16.723
It’s not what you think..

01:24:17.658 --> 01:24:20.827
It’s bad karma.

01:24:20.894 --> 01:24:22.529
Still 4 more years left

01:24:23.463 --> 01:24:26.800
unless she gets impeached
or something.

01:24:27.167 --> 01:24:29.269
[staff exhales]

01:24:31.839 --> 01:24:33.073
Good job..

01:24:33.807 --> 01:24:35.909
We are covered for everything?

01:24:37.911 --> 01:24:40.581
Well, the Assembly..

01:24:41.014 --> 01:24:43.183
The Opposition’s
resistance is stronger

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:44.451
than anticipated.

01:24:45.319 --> 01:24:48.188
Tax hikes are always
a sensitive issue.

01:24:49.156 --> 01:24:51.124
There is even a talk
of red-baiting.

01:24:57.831 --> 01:24:59.166
[scolding]

01:25:02.703 --> 01:25:04.705
Raising taxes
automatically makes us

01:25:04.771 --> 01:25:06.139
a left wing government?

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.474
[staff] Sorry, ma’am.

01:25:07.541 --> 01:25:09.142
This is the single
most important

01:25:09.209 --> 01:25:10.444
policy of this government.

01:25:10.911 --> 01:25:12.746
If we fail to enact this bill,

01:25:12.813 --> 01:25:16.250
Korea will fall behind
for another 10 years.

01:25:16.316 --> 01:25:18.552
We’ve got to be firm.

01:25:18.619 --> 01:25:20.921
We have two more days.

01:25:20.988 --> 01:25:23.156
Let’s give it our best shot.

01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:24.992
Yes, ma’am.

01:25:26.527 --> 01:25:28.195
[exhales]

01:25:43.076 --> 01:25:45.579
Aren’t you coming to bed?

01:25:45.779 --> 01:25:47.142
It’s late.

01:25:47.147 --> 01:25:49.149
It’s a statement I’m
issuing tomorrow.

01:25:49.216 --> 01:25:51.451
I’ve got to familiarize
myself with it.

01:25:53.453 --> 01:25:54.588
What’s this?

01:25:54.655 --> 01:25:56.423
It’s nothing.

01:25:57.291 --> 01:25:58.725
Get some sleep.

01:25:59.326 --> 01:26:01.795
Okay..

01:26:11.071 --> 01:26:13.740
My old buddies are
getting together tomorrow.

01:26:13.807 --> 01:26:14.975
Do you mind if I go?

01:26:17.277 --> 01:26:21.782
Please! We talked
about this before.

01:26:22.449 --> 01:26:24.818
You’re not a private
person any more.

01:26:24.885 --> 01:26:28.388
Can’t you refrain from
attending personal schedules?

01:26:28.455 --> 01:26:31.358
I wouldn’t have asked
if it wasn’t important.

01:26:31.425 --> 01:26:35.195
How do they know
your number anyway?

01:26:35.929 --> 01:26:37.898
How would they?

01:26:38.432 --> 01:26:40.267
I called them to say hello.

01:26:41.502 --> 01:26:43.770
All right.. Good night!

01:26:46.807 --> 01:26:49.176
[men] Cheers!

01:26:49.309 --> 01:26:53.447
[indistinct chatter]

01:26:54.181 --> 01:26:59.786
[Chang-myun]
A hundred pigs and ten cows.

01:27:00.454 --> 01:27:01.955
I can still do it!

01:27:02.022 --> 01:27:03.991
[friend] Watch me do it!

01:27:04.057 --> 01:27:06.793
Let’s go to your place
for more drinks!

01:27:06.994 --> 01:27:10.097
Tell your wife to
prepare some food.

01:27:10.163 --> 01:27:12.332
How dare you ask the President
to prepare your drinks?

01:27:12.366 --> 01:27:13.534
You’ll get lock up.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.337
No problem! I’ll call my wife.

01:27:17.871 --> 01:27:20.107
Let’s all go to my place
for more drinks!

01:27:20.174 --> 01:27:22.376
[yelling] Madam President!

01:27:22.442 --> 01:27:24.845
[Chang-myun]
Tell my wife to come out.

01:27:24.912 --> 01:27:28.849
Don’t embarrass me
in front of my buddies.

01:27:28.916 --> 01:27:30.217
[friend] Are these your guards?

01:27:30.284 --> 01:27:31.952
That’s Security One.

01:27:32.152 --> 01:27:35.250
That’s Two.. I don’t see Three..

01:27:35.556 --> 01:27:36.957
[Chang-myun] Hey, Three!

01:27:37.024 --> 01:27:38.192
-Get Three to come out.
-[security] Yes, sir.

01:27:38.258 --> 01:27:40.894
[friend] Are you armed with
guns and grenades?

01:27:40.961 --> 01:27:43.063
Shoot me!

01:27:43.130 --> 01:27:44.831
I’m Optimus Prime.

01:27:44.898 --> 01:27:47.034
My limbs are made of steel.

01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:49.436
Go ahead, shoot me!

01:27:49.503 --> 01:27:50.704
[Chang-myun] Stay away.

01:27:51.038 --> 01:27:52.206
Call the Residence.

01:27:55.309 --> 01:27:57.544
Tell her that Blue House is
under attack from Optimus Prime.

01:27:57.778 --> 01:27:58.779
[friend] These are
your guards, right?

01:27:58.879 --> 01:28:00.013
[friend 2] Shoot me if you dare!

01:28:00.113 --> 01:28:01.548
Where did he drink?

01:28:01.615 --> 01:28:02.883
Near Jongro, ma’am.

01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:05.586
Why didn’t you escort him back
before he got so drunk?

01:28:05.686 --> 01:28:08.889
[drunken chatter]

01:28:10.090 --> 01:28:11.525
[security] Chang-myun!

01:28:11.592 --> 01:28:14.127
Look at me!

01:28:14.461 --> 01:28:15.863
[security] He’s taking a leak!

01:28:15.929 --> 01:28:18.265
[Chang-myun] Let go of me, punk!

01:28:19.433 --> 01:28:25.372
I’ll never ever drink again.

01:28:26.874 --> 01:28:29.376
I prepared
a French-style breakfast

01:28:29.443 --> 01:28:31.845
for Madam President

01:28:33.046 --> 01:28:36.016
and some traditional fish soup

01:28:36.083 --> 01:28:37.951
for you, Professor.

01:28:38.018 --> 01:28:40.521
It’ll help you ease
the hangover.

01:28:43.557 --> 01:28:45.526
A phone was ringing
in your pocket,

01:28:45.959 --> 01:28:47.394
this morning.

01:28:47.828 --> 01:28:50.531
It was an unauthorized
cell phone.

01:28:51.064 --> 01:28:52.266
[cutleries cling]

01:28:52.799 --> 01:28:56.703
I took the call..

01:28:57.804 --> 01:29:01.408
It asked me if I needed
an urgent loan.

01:29:02.643 --> 01:29:06.113
Should the President of Korea
be receiving calls like that?

01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.815
They just call random numbers.

01:29:09.683 --> 01:29:11.585
“No interest
for the first month,” right?

01:29:12.119 --> 01:29:14.021
I got similar calls a few times.

01:29:14.087 --> 01:29:15.489
What an annoying bunch!

01:29:16.190 --> 01:29:18.025
[yelling]
That’s not the point of this!

01:29:18.759 --> 01:29:21.028
You lied to me!

01:29:22.095 --> 01:29:23.830
Are you a spy?

01:29:23.897 --> 01:29:27.234
No one else carries private
cell phones in the Blue House.

01:29:28.769 --> 01:29:29.837
I’m sorry.

01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:34.775
But, I have a personal life
outside of my duty.

01:29:35.275 --> 01:29:36.677
I normally have it switched off

01:29:36.743 --> 01:29:38.111
and only use it
in special cases..

01:29:38.178 --> 01:29:39.112
I got rid of it.

01:29:40.347 --> 01:29:41.215
What?

01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:45.619
I got rid of the phone.

01:29:46.587 --> 01:29:48.755
[grunts]
Good for you..

01:29:50.424 --> 01:29:53.393
I still have 6 months
on the contract

01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:55.262
but, never mind.

01:29:57.064 --> 01:30:01.568
[gentle song plays]

01:30:03.537 --> 01:30:05.138
[admiring]

01:30:05.205 --> 01:30:06.807
[exhales]

01:30:12.179 --> 01:30:13.680
[laughs]

01:30:15.282 --> 01:30:19.620
-[child] Hello!
-Look, who’s here!

01:30:21.321 --> 01:30:22.523
How are you?

01:30:22.589 --> 01:30:24.825
Good. He’s grown so big.

01:30:24.925 --> 01:30:26.293
[all laugh]

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.728
Have you been busy?

01:30:27.794 --> 01:30:29.530
Not so much.

01:30:29.630 --> 01:30:30.697
[chuckles]

01:30:31.198 --> 01:30:34.434
You drove here by yourself?

01:30:36.170 --> 01:30:38.639
I haven’t done it in years..
It was great.

01:30:38.705 --> 01:30:39.773
[chuckles]

01:30:42.943 --> 01:30:47.481
[gentle music plays]

01:30:52.052 --> 01:30:53.654
Why didn’t you
take the residence

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.422
that government provided?

01:30:55.489 --> 01:30:57.457
I’m grateful for the pension.

01:30:58.292 --> 01:31:00.194
Why waste money on
building a new house?

01:31:01.361 --> 01:31:02.996
You’re so stubborn.

01:31:03.063 --> 01:31:06.099
How’s the preparation
for the policy institute going?

01:31:06.233 --> 01:31:09.236
I decided to put
it on hold for now.

01:31:09.536 --> 01:31:14.808
It’s only been a year
since the handover.

01:31:15.776 --> 01:31:18.045
It could be a little too soon.

01:31:19.479 --> 01:31:20.881
I’m thinking of continuing
with my studies.

01:31:21.748 --> 01:31:23.116
It’s good to hear that.

01:31:23.851 --> 01:31:28.889
I was worried you
might open a gym.

01:31:30.190 --> 01:31:33.760
How’s life as a single dad?

01:31:36.697 --> 01:31:38.265
[Jeong-ho laughs]

01:31:48.175 --> 01:31:50.711
[motorboat approaching]

01:32:00.521 --> 01:32:05.192
[gentle music fading]

01:32:25.112 --> 01:32:26.213
Isn’t this..?

01:32:27.848 --> 01:32:29.917
[Jeong-ho's wife]
Chef Jang has them sent over

01:32:29.983 --> 01:32:32.219
every now and then.

01:32:43.363 --> 01:32:45.532
In the name of
providing good education,

tough competitions..

01:32:50.771 --> 01:32:52.806
What’s with her hair?

01:32:53.841 --> 01:32:56.944
Why do women in politics
have that same bouffant hairdo?

01:32:58.912 --> 01:33:02.015
A bright red suit?
Like a firefighter.

01:33:02.683 --> 01:33:05.152
[Kyung-ja continue speaking]

01:33:05.452 --> 01:33:07.855
Her skin looks great.

01:33:07.921 --> 01:33:09.890
Well, she gets the best facials.

01:33:10.924 --> 01:33:13.493
They have beauticians
in the Residence?

01:33:14.361 --> 01:33:17.431
Yeah.. I got one every other day.

01:33:17.865 --> 01:33:19.299
How come I never got one?

01:33:20.133 --> 01:33:22.169
Maybe it was new from my term.

01:33:22.236 --> 01:33:23.704
Well, I got them.

01:33:23.770 --> 01:33:24.671
[Jeong-ho] What?!

01:33:25.372 --> 01:33:28.842
That wretched Chief of Staff..

01:33:28.909 --> 01:33:31.078
Can we watch some TV?

01:33:31.144 --> 01:33:33.947
You don’t care now
that your terms are over?

01:33:34.014 --> 01:33:36.650
Shame on you.

01:33:38.018 --> 01:33:40.187
[Kyung-ja on TV] The Special
Administrative City Law

01:33:40.254 --> 01:33:41.755
that this government
wants to enact

01:33:42.289 --> 01:33:46.026
entails moving the capital into..

01:33:46.159 --> 01:33:48.262
[suspense music plays]

01:33:48.362 --> 01:33:50.430
Is he sure?

01:33:52.499 --> 01:33:54.368
He doesn’t talk rubbish.

01:33:58.539 --> 01:33:59.373
[door closes]

01:34:04.144 --> 01:34:05.312
[exhales]

01:34:05.779 --> 01:34:09.183
If this is true, she’s headed
directly for impeachment.

01:34:10.017 --> 01:34:11.151
[exhales]

01:34:11.385 --> 01:34:14.154
Have they lost their minds?

01:34:15.122 --> 01:34:18.792
You know I’m the best hit man
in the Opposition.

01:34:19.993 --> 01:34:22.095
Let’s strike
while the iron is hot.

01:34:22.663 --> 01:34:25.599
We can get this in tomorrow’s
morning editions.

01:34:26.433 --> 01:34:29.870
Isn’t it her birthday, tomorrow?

01:34:30.404 --> 01:34:34.842
This will be the
biggest surprise. [laughs]

01:34:34.942 --> 01:34:36.043
[door opens]

01:34:45.385 --> 01:34:47.087
-Good morning, sir!
-[kitchen staff] Morning!

01:34:47.454 --> 01:34:49.189
Is Chef Jang here?

01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:51.859
[Chef Jang] Over here, sir.

01:34:54.394 --> 01:34:56.430
-Chef!
-[chef] Yes, sir.

01:34:56.496 --> 01:34:58.131
[kitchen staffs]
Good morning, sir!

01:34:58.899 --> 01:35:00.701
-Are we all set?
-Yes, sir.

01:35:01.201 --> 01:35:05.105
[president staff] We'll look
into it right away, ma'm.

01:35:15.782 --> 01:35:16.717
Here she comes!

01:35:16.783 --> 01:35:18.452
[Chang-myun] Everyone
in their positions!

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.588
As practiced..

01:35:22.589 --> 01:35:23.718
And, one..

01:35:23.724 --> 01:35:27.261
[kitchen staffs singing]
Happy birthday to you..

01:35:27.327 --> 01:35:30.664
Happy birthday to you..

01:35:30.731 --> 01:35:33.200
Happy birthday Madam President..

01:35:33.267 --> 01:35:34.902
[yelling]
Have you lost your mind?!!

01:35:38.472 --> 01:35:39.640
[sighing]

01:35:48.482 --> 01:35:51.351
HAN GATE: THE SPECIAL
ADMIN CITY LAW,

01:35:51.418 --> 01:35:53.754
A PRESENT FOR HUSBAND?

01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:55.923
The President’s ambitious plans

01:35:55.989 --> 01:36:00.027
for relocation of the capital,

01:36:00.093 --> 01:36:03.864
was it all but a part of her
real estate speculation scheme?

01:36:03.897 --> 01:36:06.834
This is the true face
of Han’s government.

01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:08.502
[woman] It’s beyond outrageous.

01:36:08.569 --> 01:36:09.503
[man] How can we
trust a government

01:36:09.570 --> 01:36:10.938
under corrupt leadership.

01:36:11.004 --> 01:36:14.141
Is it worth keeping
this government?

01:36:15.909 --> 01:36:21.915
We must put it to the people.

01:36:22.783 --> 01:36:26.053
[sobbing] I really didn’t know!

01:36:26.119 --> 01:36:29.923
All I wanted was to raise pigs
and cows there when we retire.

01:36:30.991 --> 01:36:33.293
What are they building there?!

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.896
God damn it!

01:36:37.397 --> 01:36:39.166

[somber music plays]

01:37:30.417 --> 01:37:31.718
Where is she?

01:37:32.653 --> 01:37:34.021
At the Residence, sir.

01:37:37.391 --> 01:37:38.792
What’s going to happen now?

01:37:40.627 --> 01:37:42.863
The Opposition
will initiate a motion

01:37:42.930 --> 01:37:45.532
for impeachment at the Assembly..

01:37:51.538 --> 01:37:52.840
[sighs]

01:37:57.377 --> 01:37:58.679
Where is he?

01:37:58.745 --> 01:38:01.982
Mr. Choi went out for some air.

01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:08.922
Do I need to go
through with this?

01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:11.058
You must act

01:38:11.859 --> 01:38:13.093
as normally as possible

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:14.661
especially at times like this.

01:38:15.662 --> 01:38:17.892
If you don’t, they will

01:38:17.898 --> 01:38:20.267
bite down harder on us.

01:38:22.469 --> 01:38:24.371
[Kyung-ja] Like in a dog fight.

01:38:26.139 --> 01:38:27.741
It’s not all that exciting

01:38:28.942 --> 01:38:33.547
to celebrate a birthday,
at my age.

01:38:34.448 --> 01:38:38.085
I would like to thank all of you

01:38:38.552 --> 01:38:40.888
who came to congratulate me

01:38:41.154 --> 01:38:43.690
and apologize
for what you must ‘ve

01:38:43.957 --> 01:38:48.629
heard on the news this morning.

01:38:50.130 --> 01:38:52.933
It was a nasty
surprise for me, too.

01:38:53.767 --> 01:38:56.670
As the President,
I feel that I am

01:38:57.004 --> 01:38:59.540
solely responsible
for what happened.

01:39:02.009 --> 01:39:06.613
Today, my husband was going

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:11.946
to dance with me on stage

01:39:12.786 --> 01:39:15.522
but, he wasn’t
feeling very well..

01:39:19.693 --> 01:39:23.497
[slow music plays]

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:27.968
Ladies and Gentlemen,

01:39:28.068 --> 01:39:29.803
it’s my husband,
Choi Chang-myun.

01:39:44.885 --> 01:39:47.221
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:39:49.089 --> 01:39:51.792
[slow music continues]

01:40:04.671 --> 01:40:07.307
I’m the presidential spouse,
Choi Chang-myun.

01:40:08.408 --> 01:40:12.006
I’m sorry I’m late.

01:40:15.048 --> 01:40:18.819
Today is the birthday
of my dear wife

01:40:19.486 --> 01:40:20.988
and our President.

01:40:23.891 --> 01:40:27.327
It should have been a day
of happiness and celebration

01:40:28.829 --> 01:40:30.564
but because of me,

01:40:30.631 --> 01:40:34.868
it was one of the worst days
in her life.

01:40:36.670 --> 01:40:38.138
I had a dream of retiring

01:40:39.206 --> 01:40:42.042
to a farm with my wife.

01:40:43.076 --> 01:40:46.547
So, I bought a small ranch
with my life savings.

01:40:48.248 --> 01:40:51.051
I had no idea it would
turn out to be such a disaster.

01:40:55.155 --> 01:40:59.760
I just sold off the land.

01:41:02.529 --> 01:41:06.060
Looking back, this wasn’t
the first time.

01:41:08.001 --> 01:41:09.636
I failed to provide
the support she needs

01:41:09.703 --> 01:41:11.438
for carrying out her
duties as President.

01:41:13.073 --> 01:41:19.079
I regret so much
only adding to her burdens.

01:41:21.748 --> 01:41:24.117
And, it makes me realize

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:30.991
that I probably won’t change
as a person.

01:41:32.526 --> 01:41:34.661
So, I made a small resolution

01:41:35.596 --> 01:41:37.231
and, felt I should announce it

01:41:39.099 --> 01:41:42.436
before I have a change of heart.

01:41:50.210 --> 01:41:51.445
On the way here,

01:41:52.479 --> 01:41:55.816
I thought of you in the old days
and I got choked up.

01:41:58.318 --> 01:42:05.592
You are as beautiful now
as you have ever been.

01:42:11.365 --> 01:42:12.566
Kyung-ja..

01:42:21.208 --> 01:42:22.709
Let’s get divorced.

01:42:23.610 --> 01:42:27.814
[indistinct chatter]

01:42:31.285 --> 01:42:35.622
It’s not possible for me
to be with you

01:42:36.089 --> 01:42:38.058
and live as a
presidential spouse.

01:42:39.826 --> 01:42:42.329
[in English] What's going on?
What did he say?

01:42:47.067 --> 01:42:48.702
[speaking English]
I'm American, too..

01:42:49.536 --> 01:42:50.671
I’m so sorry.

01:42:53.373 --> 01:42:55.509
And, happy birthday.

01:42:56.910 --> 01:43:02.349
[somber music plays]

01:43:06.553 --> 01:43:09.323
[whispers]
It’s an emergency! A crisis!

01:43:09.423 --> 01:43:12.025
No, not a crisis either.

01:43:22.002 --> 01:43:24.438
[man] For the first time in
the history of Korea,

01:43:24.505 --> 01:43:26.940
[woman] a sitting President
may get divorced

01:43:27.007 --> 01:43:29.710
during her presidential term.

01:43:29.776 --> 01:43:31.912
[man] This afternoon’s
statement by Professor Choi

01:43:31.979 --> 01:43:35.115
was his sole decision

01:43:35.182 --> 01:43:37.251
[woman] which he hopes,
will allow the President

01:43:37.317 --> 01:43:40.754
to devote herself to
her presidential duties.

01:43:40.821 --> 01:43:42.289
[man] Lawyers for
Democratic Society

01:43:42.322 --> 01:43:44.057
has volunteered to
represent Professor Choi..

01:43:44.157 --> 01:43:45.492
[woman] The public points
finger of blame

01:43:45.559 --> 01:43:48.695
at the Opposition..

01:43:51.765 --> 01:43:54.601
[papers flipping]

01:43:58.305 --> 01:44:00.674
[man] Where is this going?

01:44:02.042 --> 01:44:04.278
It’s backfiring on us.

01:44:05.179 --> 01:44:06.413
[yelling] Who did you hit,

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:10.517
the President or her husband?

01:44:12.953 --> 01:44:14.488
Calm down.

01:44:14.555 --> 01:44:16.190
This is an opportunity for us.

01:44:16.256 --> 01:44:17.958
A President with
a family crisis!

01:44:18.025 --> 01:44:19.493
She’s as vulnerable as can be.

01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:22.329
Look at the survey results.

01:44:22.396 --> 01:44:23.931
Public reaction is contrary.

01:44:24.231 --> 01:44:27.234
They think we’re responsible
for the President’s divorce.

01:44:27.501 --> 01:44:33.173
Don’t you know what
she represents to the people?

01:44:33.674 --> 01:44:35.642
To the public, she’s
the mother-, wife-

01:44:35.676 --> 01:44:38.579
and daughter-in-law figure.

01:44:38.612 --> 01:44:41.982
The Mother Mary,
Korea’s Joan of Arc

01:44:42.049 --> 01:44:43.684
and Cleopatra..

01:44:44.251 --> 01:44:45.385
[sighing]

01:44:46.753 --> 01:44:47.788
Maybe not the Cleopatra..

01:44:47.855 --> 01:44:49.022
Is it not?

01:44:49.890 --> 01:44:51.024
Did I say Cleopatra?

01:44:52.693 --> 01:44:53.760
[grunting]

01:44:53.927 --> 01:44:55.128
The point is..

01:44:56.296 --> 01:44:59.466
The opposition
seems to be worried

01:45:00.367 --> 01:45:02.035
about taking the blame.

01:45:02.202 --> 01:45:04.671
Has she made up her mind
about a divorce?

01:45:06.039 --> 01:45:08.175
“President sacrificing
her marriage

01:45:08.208 --> 01:45:10.210
for the sake of her
duties”..

01:45:10.611 --> 01:45:12.306
Not bad.

01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:17.317
Professor Choi has been
a ticking time-bomb.

01:45:17.518 --> 01:45:21.855
Maybe she’s better off
without him.

01:45:21.889 --> 01:45:24.024
Have you ever been
through a divorce?

01:45:24.191 --> 01:45:26.226
No, I’m happily married.

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:28.328
I went through with it twice.

01:45:28.362 --> 01:45:29.696
When was the second time?

01:45:29.730 --> 01:45:33.867
The first time was
not in the record.

01:45:34.201 --> 01:45:37.137
You think a divorce
will allow you

01:45:37.271 --> 01:45:38.939
to focus better on your job?

01:45:38.972 --> 01:45:40.474
Who should be handling
the matter anyway?

01:45:40.507 --> 01:45:41.708
The personnel affairs?

01:45:41.808 --> 01:45:44.545
How come? It goes under
political affairs.

01:45:44.611 --> 01:45:45.379
What?

01:45:45.412 --> 01:45:47.548
Definitely not
the foreign policy.

01:45:48.081 --> 01:45:49.416
Leave me out of this.

01:45:51.418 --> 01:45:53.253
How can you let this happen?

01:45:53.287 --> 01:45:54.621
You know what dad’s like!

01:45:54.788 --> 01:45:57.057
What about me?

01:45:58.058 --> 01:46:00.861
Are you blaming me for
what he has done?

01:46:01.261 --> 01:46:04.198
But, you know how hard
it has been for him.

01:46:04.298 --> 01:46:06.266
Before being one man’s wife,

01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:08.101
I’m the President
of this country.

01:46:08.302 --> 01:46:09.603
How can I do my job

01:46:09.636 --> 01:46:12.472
if I have family
troubles to worry about.

01:46:12.506 --> 01:46:15.108
If he can’t put up with it..
then, we have no choice.

01:46:15.142 --> 01:46:19.813
-Please mother..
-He started it all.

01:46:20.714 --> 01:46:22.316
Even if he comes back,

01:46:22.349 --> 01:46:24.551
things won’t
change for the better.

01:46:25.352 --> 01:46:27.187
[yelling]
Suit yourself, Madam President.

01:46:32.593 --> 01:46:35.896
I loved him with all my heart.

01:46:38.365 --> 01:46:40.801
However, since taking office,

01:46:42.102 --> 01:46:45.372
I found loving someone as

01:46:45.405 --> 01:46:49.676
a private person
a very difficult task.

01:46:51.812 --> 01:46:55.048
Today, I’m mustering
up the courage

01:46:55.115 --> 01:47:00.521
to make an announcement about
a decision I made.

01:47:03.690 --> 01:47:09.663
I decided to remain by myself

01:47:09.696 --> 01:47:18.105
as your President,
not as a wife to a..

01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:25.812
God, this is corny!

01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:28.815
What’s with
the humiliating tone?

01:47:28.849 --> 01:47:33.754
Am I begging for sympathy
for a poor divorcée?

01:47:34.555 --> 01:47:36.990
What’s with “tears” in brackets?

01:47:37.191 --> 01:47:38.825
You want me to cry here?

01:47:39.359 --> 01:47:40.761
[sobs]

01:47:40.861 --> 01:47:45.732
Today, I stand before you
as your President,

01:47:45.799 --> 01:47:48.869
not a wife to a man.. [sobs]

01:47:50.871 --> 01:47:51.905
Like this?

01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:55.075
I’m sorry, ma’am.

01:47:55.642 --> 01:47:57.678
We’ve never dealt with
this kind of situation..

01:47:58.612 --> 01:48:02.282
Should the President
present herself

01:48:02.349 --> 01:48:04.218
at the court for divorce?

01:48:04.751 --> 01:48:06.954
For formalities..

01:48:07.888 --> 01:48:11.892
And other things like alimony..

01:48:12.659 --> 01:48:15.596
[man] She is praised
as the mother figure

01:48:15.662 --> 01:48:18.065
of the 21st century.

01:48:18.332 --> 01:48:20.868
And now,
she’s fallen a victim of

01:48:20.934 --> 01:48:24.505
a political snare
thanks to the Opposition.

01:48:24.938 --> 01:48:26.807
Although he claimed
an innocent coincidence,

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:29.142
he did buy land awaiting
major development.

01:48:29.409 --> 01:48:32.045
Please, let’s use some
common sense here.

01:48:32.112 --> 01:48:36.917
The President’s husband bought
the land in his own name

01:48:36.984 --> 01:48:38.852
so that the world will know

01:48:38.919 --> 01:48:40.988
when he makes a huge
profit out of it?

01:48:41.054 --> 01:48:43.557
A five-year-old
would laugh at that.

01:48:43.857 --> 01:48:46.693
Well, he just did
that laughable thing.

01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:48.629
Are you listening
to what I’m saying?

01:48:48.695 --> 01:48:52.399
It’s not us that’s funny but
the way you people think.

01:48:52.466 --> 01:48:55.402
Some claim that the
President has made up her mind

01:48:55.469 --> 01:48:57.638
about the divorce.

01:48:57.704 --> 01:48:59.173
Nothing has been decided.

01:48:59.239 --> 01:49:01.308
Please be careful
with the wording.

01:49:01.375 --> 01:49:06.013
Our society places
great value on family,

01:49:06.113 --> 01:49:08.649
which is why the public
is so concerned.

01:49:08.849 --> 01:49:10.517
[woman] They say “Cultivate
body, order family

01:49:10.584 --> 01:49:11.451
then, make peace for the world”.

01:49:11.652 --> 01:49:14.221
People are concerned
as to whether or not

01:49:14.288 --> 01:49:15.722
she’ll be able to carry out
her duties

01:49:15.789 --> 01:49:17.858
without the support
of a solid family

01:49:17.925 --> 01:49:18.759
behind her.

01:49:18.825 --> 01:49:20.961
It’s funny you should say that.

01:49:21.028 --> 01:49:25.232
The former President Cha
was a wifeless father.

01:49:25.299 --> 01:49:28.936
Did he ever have solid
family support behind him?

01:49:29.136 --> 01:49:30.604
A wifeless father?!

01:49:31.305 --> 01:49:32.806
Did you just refer
to the former President

01:49:32.873 --> 01:49:33.974
as a “wifeless father?”

01:49:34.474 --> 01:49:37.110
Are you trying to insult
the former head of state?

01:49:37.177 --> 01:49:41.715
[yelling] What uneducated
absurdity?

01:49:41.782 --> 01:49:43.817
[yelling] How dare you
talk to me like that?

01:49:43.884 --> 01:49:45.586
How old are you?

01:49:45.652 --> 01:49:47.721
Why are you asking me my age?

01:49:47.788 --> 01:49:48.889
We were in the same class
in college.

01:49:48.922 --> 01:49:50.424
How old I am is how old you are!

01:49:50.490 --> 01:49:52.359
I failed my entrance
exams twice.

01:49:52.426 --> 01:49:53.460
That’s fantastic!

01:49:53.527 --> 01:49:55.462
Well done for
re-taking your exams!

01:49:55.529 --> 01:49:57.764
You must be really proud!

01:49:57.831 --> 01:49:59.499
Are you mocking me?

01:49:59.566 --> 01:50:02.536
You have just insulted
the 200,000 students nationwide

01:50:02.603 --> 01:50:03.904
that are re-taking exams.

01:50:03.971 --> 01:50:05.939
[woman]
What did I ever say about them?

01:50:06.006 --> 01:50:07.508
I’m talking about you!

01:50:07.574 --> 01:50:09.743
[man]
Take your words back this moment

01:50:09.810 --> 01:50:11.345
or I’ll see to it
that you pay for it.

01:50:11.411 --> 01:50:12.913
[woman]
I can’t and I won’t!!

01:50:12.980 --> 01:50:15.349
[man] Make a public apology
right this moment!

01:50:18.952 --> 01:50:20.053
Hey, little guy!

01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:23.490
No books or TV
or talking on the phone

01:50:23.557 --> 01:50:27.294
while eating your dinner, okay?

01:50:27.394 --> 01:50:33.433
[phone vibrating]

01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.648
Hello? This is Cha Ji-wook.

01:50:47.714 --> 01:50:52.519
I hope I’m not interrupting you
at a busy time.

01:50:52.553 --> 01:50:54.922
I have a favor to ask.

01:50:55.789 --> 01:51:00.127
[sighs] Would you be willing
to give a lecture

01:51:00.194 --> 01:51:02.896
for my students?

01:51:04.898 --> 01:51:07.401
I’ll check my schedule.

01:51:09.269 --> 01:51:10.671
[man on TV] This morning,

01:51:10.737 --> 01:51:14.308
the President invited
her two predecessors,

01:51:14.374 --> 01:51:17.477
the former Presidents Kim
and Cha,

01:51:17.544 --> 01:51:20.814
to a luncheon at the Blue House

01:51:20.881 --> 01:51:23.584
and discussed
the main objectives

01:51:23.650 --> 01:51:28.689
and pending issues
of her government.

01:51:33.393 --> 01:51:42.936
[students cheering and clapping]

01:51:48.041 --> 01:51:49.309
[mic checks]

01:51:58.385 --> 01:51:59.887
Hello, it’s great to meet you!

01:52:00.554 --> 01:52:05.292
I studied politics at
university like yourselves

01:52:05.893 --> 01:52:10.931
and served as the President
until last year

01:52:13.233 --> 01:52:16.436
in case, some of
you didn’t know.

01:52:16.603 --> 01:52:19.773
[students laugh]

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:22.576
You parted with
your wife quite early

01:52:22.643 --> 01:52:24.978
and served your term without
the support of a First Lady.

01:52:25.045 --> 01:52:31.318
I think you might have hopes of
meeting someone special again.

01:52:31.385 --> 01:52:34.354
Did you meet that special person
during your tenure?

01:52:36.823 --> 01:52:37.958
Umm..

01:52:38.859 --> 01:52:43.263
That’s class A confidentiality.

01:52:43.497 --> 01:52:47.067
[students laugh]

01:52:48.168 --> 01:52:53.607
[students] Tell us! Tell us!

01:52:54.942 --> 01:52:56.343
Hmm..

01:53:01.315 --> 01:53:07.521
On many occasions,
I felt lonely.

01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:11.391
Even if I had the best advisers

01:53:11.458 --> 01:53:17.564
and was surrounded by people
who had faith in me.

01:53:19.733 --> 01:53:21.768
There were times I wanted
to be in love again

01:53:23.537 --> 01:53:25.606
to have that special feeling
for someone.

01:53:27.474 --> 01:53:29.109
But, I found that
as a President,

01:53:30.911 --> 01:53:34.915
it’s difficult to love
one person only.

01:53:35.349 --> 01:53:38.785
[somber music plays]

01:53:39.119 --> 01:53:40.487
It’s a job where
it’s extremely difficult

01:53:40.554 --> 01:53:45.192
to love, cherish and
respect one person.

01:53:48.962 --> 01:53:51.498
So, I gave it up.

01:53:54.067 --> 01:53:59.239
And now, I regret giving it up
so much.

01:54:00.607 --> 01:54:03.677
I had lunch with President Han
this afternoon.

01:54:04.811 --> 01:54:06.146
As you know,

01:54:07.247 --> 01:54:09.583
she is going through
a tough time at the moment.

01:54:11.285 --> 01:54:14.221
I told her what I learned
from my experience.

01:54:15.622 --> 01:54:18.258
To be President for one person

01:54:18.325 --> 01:54:20.994
when it comes to
a certain moment.

01:54:24.398 --> 01:54:25.866
In order to avoid

01:54:27.935 --> 01:54:29.970
having regrets later on.

01:54:30.170 --> 01:54:32.840
[somber music continues]

01:54:33.707 --> 01:54:41.582
[students clapping and cheering]

01:54:51.158 --> 01:54:52.960
You were fantastic today.

01:54:53.026 --> 01:54:54.795
Don’t flatter me.

01:54:56.797 --> 01:54:58.565
It’s getting chilly.

01:55:15.616 --> 01:55:17.885
Air’s great in this part
of the town, isn’t it?

01:55:17.951 --> 01:55:19.753
[Ji-wook farts]

01:55:30.063 --> 01:55:36.570
[romantic music plays]

01:55:46.046 --> 01:55:48.482
It happens when I’m nervous.

01:55:50.184 --> 01:55:51.318
[gulps]

01:55:52.586 --> 01:55:56.623
[somber music plays]

01:56:10.704 --> 01:56:12.206
[chuckles]

01:56:17.277 --> 01:56:21.715
[somber music continues]

01:56:31.091 --> 01:56:32.526
[chefs grunt]

01:56:45.539 --> 01:56:50.544
I haven’t cooked in years.

01:56:50.611 --> 01:56:53.614
Mr. Choi is a good cook.

01:56:54.781 --> 01:56:56.550
He made food here?

01:56:56.617 --> 01:56:58.619
Time to time, ma’am.

01:56:58.685 --> 01:57:00.854
On your birthday,
it was Mr. Choi

01:57:00.921 --> 01:57:03.557
who made your birthday soup.

01:57:05.058 --> 01:57:07.995
So typical of him.

01:57:09.796 --> 01:57:11.765
How come you’re not married?

01:57:13.767 --> 01:57:16.336
My youngest is going
to college this year.

01:57:17.271 --> 01:57:21.041
Excuse me!

01:57:21.675 --> 01:57:24.545
Why did I think you
weren’t married..

01:57:25.245 --> 01:57:26.980
Please forgive me.

01:57:27.047 --> 01:57:28.415
That’s okay.

01:57:29.016 --> 01:57:31.952
I get that from time to time.

01:57:32.152 --> 01:57:33.587
[both chuckle]

01:57:37.991 --> 01:57:39.226
How are things?

01:57:40.227 --> 01:57:40.961
Pardon?

01:57:42.162 --> 01:57:44.131
How are things at home?

01:57:44.531 --> 01:57:51.805
I don’t go home much but
still, it’s great. [laughs]

01:57:52.773 --> 01:57:55.809
[somber music plays]

01:57:56.276 --> 01:57:59.213
A President could make
her people happy,

01:58:01.181 --> 01:58:03.650
even if she isn’t happy herself,
couldn’t she?

01:58:05.485 --> 01:58:06.854
The President

01:58:08.388 --> 01:58:10.991
doesn’t necessarily
have to be happy

01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:17.464
to make the lives
of people better, right?

01:58:18.365 --> 01:58:23.103
I may be wrong but I believe..

01:58:23.637 --> 01:58:30.711
just as a President wishes that
all her people are happy,

01:58:30.777 --> 01:58:34.481
everyone wants their President
to be happy.

01:58:34.548 --> 01:58:38.619
Not a single person would want
the President to be miserable.

01:58:40.787 --> 01:58:41.855
You think so?

01:58:42.689 --> 01:58:45.292
That’s what people want.

01:58:45.993 --> 01:58:49.429
It would be nice
if the President devoted herself

01:58:49.496 --> 01:58:51.098
to making the people happy

01:58:51.164 --> 01:58:55.903
but people who have a miserable
President cannot be truly happy.

01:58:56.403 --> 01:58:58.038
Koreans are good people,

01:58:58.105 --> 01:59:02.409
A lot more so than
you might think.

01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:07.848
They are, aren’t they?

01:59:09.816 --> 01:59:18.392
I’m only a cook
but I know that much.

01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:21.061
[chuckles]

01:59:22.796 --> 01:59:24.264
Can I leave this to you?

01:59:27.968 --> 01:59:31.772
You know I had lunch with
the two former Presidents.

01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:35.075
They both told me
to pay a visit here,

01:59:35.943 --> 01:59:39.713
when faced with a dilemma
that I cannot solve by myself.

01:59:41.682 --> 01:59:43.784
Now I can see what they meant.

01:59:45.752 --> 01:59:47.154
Thank you.

01:59:51.758 --> 01:59:54.194
Where can she be at this hour?

01:59:55.462 --> 01:59:56.697
She’s not at the Residence.

01:59:56.763 --> 01:59:57.898
[staff] Sir,

02:00:00.601 --> 02:00:02.803
I received a report that
she just left the main gate.

02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:04.738
What are you talking about?

02:00:05.606 --> 02:00:06.907
[staff] Sir!

02:00:07.774 --> 02:00:09.009
The main gate!

02:00:09.176 --> 02:00:11.578
Right! The main gate!

02:00:11.678 --> 02:00:13.914
Don’t get in the way
you idiots!

02:00:14.081 --> 02:00:20.320
[suspense music plays]

02:00:26.193 --> 02:00:29.630
Why did you let
her pass by herself?

02:00:29.696 --> 02:00:33.467
Would she go grocery shopping
at this hour, dumbass?

02:00:37.070 --> 02:00:38.539
I’ll have you killed,
all of you!

02:00:38.605 --> 02:00:39.606
[staff] Sorry, sir!

02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:44.811
[suspense music continues]

02:00:51.818 --> 02:00:54.254
What did you say
to her that made her

02:00:54.321 --> 02:00:56.290
disappear in
the middle of the night?

02:00:56.356 --> 02:00:58.125
We were just chatting
about happiness

02:00:58.192 --> 02:01:00.527
and other things..

02:01:00.594 --> 02:01:04.665
While picking anchovy guts?

02:01:05.065 --> 02:01:06.733
What are you talking about?

02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:09.536
God, this is annoying!

02:01:09.970 --> 02:01:11.638
Turn on the GPS.

02:01:11.705 --> 02:01:14.908
Have a chopper
locate the vehicle.

02:01:14.975 --> 02:01:16.476
It’s the Blue House.

02:01:17.110 --> 02:01:18.712
I’m the Chief of Security.

02:01:18.779 --> 02:01:20.747
We know where she is headed.

02:01:20.814 --> 02:01:22.082
Give them a call, too.

02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:23.250
Put me on!

02:01:23.317 --> 02:01:24.384
Chief Joo?

02:01:24.451 --> 02:01:25.986
This is the Chief of Personnel.

02:01:26.053 --> 02:01:27.788
Don’t have her
pull over in the city.

02:01:27.855 --> 02:01:31.091
We can’t let anyone see her.

02:01:31.158 --> 02:01:35.295
Don’t let the press find out,
no matter what!

02:01:35.362 --> 02:01:38.565
[yelling] Escort her
out of the city, okay?

02:01:45.372 --> 02:01:50.143
[suspense music continues]

02:01:59.653 --> 02:02:01.955
[cars reviving]

02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:15.135
[man] She entered the highway.

02:02:15.202 --> 02:02:16.470
Where’s the next
bottle neck point?

02:02:16.537 --> 02:02:18.172
An-sung Intersection, sir.

02:02:19.173 --> 02:02:20.474
Stop the vehicle before

02:02:20.541 --> 02:02:21.742
she enters the intersection.

02:02:21.808 --> 02:02:23.477
And, set up a road block in E7.

02:02:29.650 --> 02:02:32.319
WEST COAST HIGHWAY

02:02:38.892 --> 02:02:42.196
[music continues]

02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:39.820
I’m sorry but this is
a personal matter.

02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:41.855
I assumed from the direction
you were heading.

02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:45.626
It’s appropriate to use
the official escort for this.

02:03:45.659 --> 02:03:47.060
Please let me
take the wheel, ma’am.

02:03:47.995 --> 02:03:49.963
I don’t need an escort.

02:03:50.631 --> 02:03:52.065
I won’t be long.

02:03:52.766 --> 02:03:55.428
Your driver’s license
has expired.

02:03:57.638 --> 02:03:59.106
Would you like me to
call you a cab?

02:04:00.007 --> 02:04:01.842
[sighs]

02:04:10.584 --> 02:04:13.453
[gate opens]

02:04:22.896 --> 02:04:24.331
Maintain positions.

02:04:24.831 --> 02:04:28.302
Destination is
Madam President’s in-laws’.

02:04:30.737 --> 02:04:35.976
[upbeat music plays]

02:04:51.692 --> 02:04:52.826
Here they are!

02:04:53.093 --> 02:04:56.763
[cars approaching]

02:05:33.734 --> 02:05:35.269
[exhales]

02:05:38.272 --> 02:05:40.607
You drove here.
Why are you out of breath?

02:05:49.249 --> 02:05:51.218
Shall we.. dance?

02:05:52.286 --> 02:05:53.854
[sighs]

02:05:55.255 --> 02:06:01.995
[waltz music plays]

02:06:50.177 --> 02:06:51.845
[hushing]

02:07:11.732 --> 02:07:13.333
Did you practice?

02:07:14.201 --> 02:07:15.536
[chuckles]

02:07:29.082 --> 02:07:35.656
[romantic music plays]

02:07:40.627 --> 02:07:42.229
Did you mark “6”?

02:07:42.829 --> 02:07:44.364
Mind your own ticket.

02:07:44.765 --> 02:07:46.867
Let me see what you got.

02:07:46.934 --> 02:07:47.901
Don’t look at mine.

02:07:47.968 --> 02:07:49.102
Focus on yours.

02:07:49.169 --> 02:07:50.871
You have a lovely temper!

02:07:50.938 --> 02:07:53.540
“6” is a good number.

02:07:53.607 --> 02:07:55.042
Says who?

02:07:55.509 --> 02:07:57.911
I hope I win the jackpot
this time.

02:07:57.945 --> 02:07:59.012
It’s not easy

02:07:59.213 --> 02:08:03.116
I know because
I’ve done it before.

02:08:03.217 --> 02:08:05.586
You’ll give it all away again?

02:08:05.652 --> 02:08:07.421
I’ll keep it all for myself.

02:08:14.928 --> 02:08:20.567
[Chef Jang] People think that
Presidents are special people.

02:08:21.935 --> 02:08:24.738
Of course, they are not wrong
in thinking that.

02:08:26.173 --> 02:08:32.479
But, what we often forget
is that at certain moments,

02:08:32.646 --> 02:08:39.019
they are someone’s husband,
wife or parent.

02:08:39.853 --> 02:08:44.391
Their joy, sadness and happiness

02:08:44.958 --> 02:08:48.529
is not all that different
from our own.

02:08:58.138 --> 02:09:05.345
If an old President
comes over for a drinks,

02:09:05.812 --> 02:09:08.815
or a President who
has given up smoking

02:09:08.882 --> 02:09:10.651
asks for a cigarette.

02:09:11.018 --> 02:09:11.852
A VERY SPECIAL KITCHEN

02:09:11.919 --> 02:09:13.820
In the early morning,

02:09:13.887 --> 02:09:16.490
when he greets you with hello

02:09:17.057 --> 02:09:21.995
we say to him with a big smile,

02:09:23.096 --> 02:09:25.758
“Good morning, President!”

02:09:32.406 --> 02:09:39.413
