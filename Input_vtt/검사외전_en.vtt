Seduces stupid girls
Says he's from Pennsylvania

00:01:24.877 --> 00:01:27.462
He wants to be a star

No resort at the bird sanctuary!

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.726
No resort at the bird sanctuary!

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.520
Stop it right now!

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:30.984
Hey.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.402
Why are you so late?

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.071
Sorry, boss.
The traffic was bad.

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:35.447
Damn bastards!

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:36.448
- Hurry.
- Yes, sir.

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.785
- Where the hell are you going?
- I hate that bastard...

00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:40.827
You, beanpole!

00:02:42.246 --> 00:02:44.164
Yes, you, I asked
where you're going!

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.875
Damn bastard, focus!

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.752
You think this is a joke?

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.337
What is wrong with you?

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:53.841
He's got asthma,
sorry boss.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.719
What am I supposed to do
with these losers? Damn it.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.388
Save Asan Bay!
Save it!

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:00.848
Strike them!

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:02.850
Stop the construction!

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:04.059
Stop it!

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:04.935
Stop it now!

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:09.356
Stop the resort construction
right now!

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.275
Stop it right now!

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.026
Stop the construction!

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:14.987
Save the bay!

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:22.077
If you cross the police line...

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:24.454
we can arrest you for violating
the assembly law.

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:25.622
What the hell...?

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:32.004
You just violated the law!

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:36.008
Drop your weapon!

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:41.889
Drop your weapon!

00:03:43.307 --> 00:03:47.477
It's the final warning.
You can be arrested on site.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.652
You little...

00:03:56.028 --> 00:03:57.821
You can be arrested on site.

00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:00.365
You just violated the law!

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:05.996
Stop them!

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:09.750
Stop them!
Don't let them through!

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:12.794
Block them!

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.421
Stop them!

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.302
They sure do work hard.

00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:25.807
At the Asan Bay bird sanctuary,
where Far East Construction

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.435
is trying to build
its largest resort,

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:33.815
there was major bloodshed today
between police and an NGO.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.401
Having occupied the site
for over 50 days,

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.780
100 environmental activists
resisted police enforcement

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.699
using iron pipes
and other weapons.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.912
Some extreme members acted
with illegal violent force

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:49.748
turning the bird sanctuary
into a lawless area.

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:54.711
In the crackdown,
combat officer Lee Jae-seung

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.589
was struck on the head
with a blunt weapon

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.967
and is still unconscious.

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:04.012
NGO member Lee Jin-seok
who struck the policeman

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.931
was apprehended by police.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.561
So are you going to
keep acting up like this?

00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:14.773
I've told you 100 times,
I know nothing about this.

00:05:15.274 --> 00:05:16.817
You disguised gangsters

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:22.155
as environmental activists
to turn the protest violent!

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:25.450
There's circumstantial evidence
that funds from your company

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.869
went to a gang.

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:31.123
Who the hell wants to trap me?

00:05:31.123 --> 00:05:33.208
- You know I originally...
- Hey, Jang Hyun-seok.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:39.464
The bastard who hit the
cop's head is coming in soon.

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:44.553
A few words with him,
and you're done.

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.348
Why are you talking so much?

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.559
Please check these.

00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:51.894
Prosecutor Byun,

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.897
are you issuing a ruling
before the trial?

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.817
I'm still an innocent citizen.
You know well!

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:02.779
How dare you

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.617
raise your voice?
Who's behind you?

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:10.162
Nobody's behind me.
It's a hard life for everyone.

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:13.123
I guess you've been really lucky

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.502
meeting only generous
prosecutors so far.

00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:18.045
Sir.

00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.340
Haven't you ever thought

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.594
that your passion might block
your path to success?

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:28.805
A cornered stone meets
the mason's chisel...

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:31.517
What the hell?

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.520
This is violation of human rights!

00:06:34.937 --> 00:06:36.522
Violation of human rights?

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:38.649
You damn bastard...

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:40.734
Come here.
Stand straight.

00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:45.781
Three years preparing!
Four years at college!

00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:49.284
Four years of
cramming for the exam!

00:06:52.663 --> 00:06:58.001
You know why I slaved 11 years
to become a prosecutor?

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.424
To legally kick the gangsters like you!

00:07:04.842 --> 00:07:06.426
You know that?

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.350
I know your current situation.

00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:17.646
But let's not see this
as a political matter.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.858
Byun has caused
lots of problems already.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.986
People upstairs
have their eye on this.

00:07:23.986 --> 00:07:26.238
I got your point, sir.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.823
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR
WOO JONG-GIL

00:07:27.823 --> 00:07:32.286
I will handle the case myself
not to cause any inconvenience

00:07:32.286 --> 00:07:34.413
to the people upstairs.

00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:43.964
Congressman,
it's me, Min-woo.

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:45.632
Let me pour you a drink.

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:49.386
Oh, I'll pour you
the nice stuff.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:54.016
It made me so proud
watching you conduct

00:07:54.016 --> 00:07:56.185
the government offices inspection.

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.271
Those bastard ministers
didn't know a thing.

00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:00.230
Absolutely.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.191
They only took Civil Service Exam.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:06.278
Hey, Byun Jae-wook.
What is wrong with you?

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.702
After all the trouble you caused,
you hit a suspect again?

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:17.748
I'm sorry, Chief.
It was my mistake.

00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:21.835
Next time,
I'll beat him so hard

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:25.506
that he'll beg for his life
and not bother us anymore.

00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:26.965
You bastard.

00:08:29.468 --> 00:08:32.387
You think others don't use
violence 'cause they can't?

00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:37.226
We are administers of law.
What would happen

00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:39.728
if we ignore due process?

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.190
Sometimes...

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.735
you only can fix bad habits
with a beating.

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:48.737
Enough.

00:08:50.322 --> 00:08:55.202
Lee Jin-seok came in today
for police assault.

00:08:58.372 --> 00:08:59.957
Let Yang handle it.

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:03.001
No, sir.

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.880
We have to beat Lee to get Jang,
and we have to beat Jang.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.883
to get those politicians related to
the bird sanctuary development.

00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:15.472
- What is wrong with him?
- I'm sorry, sir.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.432
We've had a hard time
because of him...

00:09:30.863 --> 00:09:32.614
Go get some fresh air.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:36.660
We were told to turn over
this case to Prosecutor Yang.

00:09:37.703 --> 00:09:39.538
I said get out!

00:09:59.892 --> 00:10:03.270
You smashed a cop's head
with an iron pipe

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:07.399
but the pipe
wasn't originally from that site.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:11.612
We were there
to protect the environment.

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.366
Protect nature?

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.827
Environmental activism is great.

00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:22.164
But you know what?
After you hit him...

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.584
public opinion
is now pro-development.

00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:31.673
Don't you think
something smells fishy?

00:10:32.591 --> 00:10:36.512
It was a mistake that
happened in a chaotic situation.

00:10:36.512 --> 00:10:38.347
Many of us were hit too.

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:43.644
What group do you belong to?

00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:45.103
Pardon?

00:10:45.312 --> 00:10:48.106
You don't even know
the name of your organization?

00:10:48.232 --> 00:10:49.942
Listen, sir.

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:55.989
Once migratory birds leave Russia,
they keep flying for 15 days

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.574
without landing or eating...

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.493
The bird sanctuary is the place

00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:03.205
where those birds stop by
to eat and rest.

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:06.124
If we develop this habitat

00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:09.211
the birds would come and all die.

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:12.464
One species of bird
will go extinct.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.760
You have a good memory.

00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:19.596
Who wrote that line for you?

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.182
I knew it myself.

00:11:27.813 --> 00:11:29.189
Listen, Lee Jin-seok.

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:34.486
A middle school graduate turned into
an environmental activist?

00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:38.574
You want me to believe it?

00:11:38.574 --> 00:11:41.827
So an undereducated ex-convict
can't protect nature?

00:11:41.827 --> 00:11:43.078
Take off your shirt.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.831
I don't want to.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.374
I said take it off!

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:48.375
No, I won't.

00:11:49.835 --> 00:11:51.795
What is wrong with you?
Please!

00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:53.463
- Stand up. Attention!
- Please let me go...

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:54.840
Stand straight!

00:11:55.174 --> 00:11:56.341
Straight!

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:01.722
Take off your shirt!

00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:04.308
Why should I...

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.064
I said take it off!

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.504
Look at you, brat!

00:12:34.505 --> 00:12:37.508
Look at this nice
artwork on your body!

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:39.676
You bastard.

00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:42.429
You claim to be an activist

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.515
when you have this
big tattoo on your body?

00:12:50.187 --> 00:12:52.564
You'll never get out of here.

00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:56.318
I'll search out everyone
related to you.

00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:57.778
Everyone.

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.781
SUWON DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:03.909
Hey, wake up.
Jae-wook!

00:13:07.204 --> 00:13:09.081
I told you not to
mess with me!

00:13:11.542 --> 00:13:13.168
What the hell
are you talking about?

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.797
I heard you locked up
Lee Jin-seok all day long!

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.299
Are you trying to screw me?

00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:22.302
Why are you bothering me
so early in the morning?

00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:24.888
Stop that nonsense
and return him to me.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.558
I won't stand here and
let you screw us over.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.728
All right,
just let me sleep 5 more mins.

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:36.066
I stayed up all night!

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.194
Damn it.

00:13:43.574 --> 00:13:44.783
Morning!

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:47.911
Where are night shifters?
Why is the monitor off?

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:49.621
- Bastards...
- Don't know.

00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:51.623
- Get ready quick.
- Yes, sir.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:02.134
Hey!
Wake up, Mr. Lee!

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:04.678
Rise and shine!

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:07.764
Let's wrap this up
and have breakfast!

00:14:23.614 --> 00:14:24.740
Lee Jin-seok.

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.118
Hey you!

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:29.870
Lee Jin-seok!

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.956
Chief Kang!

00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:34.541
- Answer me!
- Yes, sir.

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:37.002
What's wrong with him?
What happened last night?

00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:39.129
I don't know...
I didn't do the night shift.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.756
Call him quick!

00:14:40.923 --> 00:14:41.924
Hurry!

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.938
You have the right to
remain silent

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:57.898
and the right to an attorney.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.566
Anything you say
can and will be

00:14:59.608 --> 00:15:02.027
used against you
in a court of law.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:05.489
D.A. Byun Jae-wook, arrested
without warrant for murdering

00:15:05.531 --> 00:15:08.367
a police assault suspect,
exits the prosecutor's office.

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:10.869
The case relates to a dispute

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:12.454
over developing
the bird sanctuary...

00:15:12.538 --> 00:15:16.959
Shockingly, the prosecutor killed
the suspect during his interrogation.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:21.046
Citizens are demanding a
transparent and fair investigation

00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:25.425
into the practices
that caused this incident.

00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:30.138
Dear citizens.

00:15:30.514 --> 00:15:33.600
As Deputy Chief Prosecutor
I sincerely apologize

00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:39.356
for the foul play of Byun Jae-wook

00:15:39.565 --> 00:15:42.651
and accept full
responsibility for this.

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:54.954
Did the defendant
directly order the witness

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:56.790
to leave the interrogation room?

00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:58.750
Yes.

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:01.545
Prosecutor Byun
ordered me himself.

00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:03.922
The defendant Byun claims that

00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:06.966
the victim died of asthma-related
breathing difficulties.

00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:08.177
Is it correct?

00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:10.846
No way.

00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:14.975
Jin-seok was sound as a bell.

00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:19.479
Defendant Byun Jae-wook
had previously caused trouble

00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:23.358
both internally and externally
with his violent tactics.

00:16:24.443 --> 00:16:27.487
His mistaken views
about governmental power

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:32.034
led to this criminal act of
assault and homicide,

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:36.788
undermining public trust
in the prosecution as a whole.

00:16:37.623 --> 00:16:39.958
To re-establish justice
and the rule of law

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:43.629
using this case as an example,

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:48.717
we hereby ask for
15 years imprisonment.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.431
Look at him!

00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:57.559
You're so screwed,
Mr. Prosecutor.

00:17:02.523 --> 00:17:04.274
Lift your damn head up.

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:08.570
Remember me?
I'm the Iron from Gunsan.

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:19.665
Here, sir.

00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:27.297
The human body is so mysterious.

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:31.051
All because of
this small object...

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:13.969
Take off your shoes.

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.362
Wow!

00:18:33.739 --> 00:18:35.199
Look who's here.

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:37.910
It's been a while, sir.

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:42.372
Never expected
to see you like this.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.212
Damn, you scared me.

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:52.466
Why no answer?

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:55.928
At least pretend to listen
when people talk to you.

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:59.056
I think I gave you 20 years total.

00:18:59.306 --> 00:19:02.976
First, 3 years for special robbery
and then 17 years for murder.

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:04.102
Great.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.815
Excellent memory!
So smart!

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.693
From Seoul University, right?

00:19:13.237 --> 00:19:15.822
Let's exchange greetings
since we'll be together so long.

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:20.077
Of course.
Greetings.

00:19:20.786 --> 00:19:22.329
You guys give him
good greetings.

00:19:22.371 --> 00:19:23.539
Let's go.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.251
Bastard!

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:32.089
- I said 'don't move!'
- Hold that bastard.

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:33.882
Bastard!

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:40.931
You'll spend
your whole life with me!

00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:42.432
Isn't that nice?

00:19:43.392 --> 00:19:44.393
Damn bastard!

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:46.395
You must be damn happy!

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:47.729
Here he comes!

00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:51.608
Nice.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.945
What's all the fuss for?

00:19:57.072 --> 00:20:00.909
We're exchanging greetings
with the newbie.

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:03.036
Cool it now and
get ready for roll call.

00:20:03.287 --> 00:20:04.788
Yes, sir.

00:20:10.002 --> 00:20:11.879
Three, two, one.
One!

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.797
Three, two, one.
Two!

00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:15.591
Three, two, one.
Three!

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:17.467
Three, two, one.
Four!

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:19.219
Three, two, one.
Five!

00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:21.096
Three, two, one.
Six!

00:20:21.138 --> 00:20:22.848
Three, two, one.
Seven!

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.100
Don't stare,
you idiot!

00:20:27.728 --> 00:20:29.146
You want to get smart, bastard?

00:20:29.313 --> 00:20:32.065
You think you're a prosecutor
in here too?

00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:41.825
What is it?

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:43.243
Let me see.

00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:47.331
Bring the bandage!

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:50.876
The long-delayed development

00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:52.586
- of the Asan Bay Bird Sanctuary
- Focus!

00:20:52.628 --> 00:20:55.339
resumed today with
a groundbreaking ceremony.

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:59.134
Alongside President Jang
of Far East Construction,

00:20:59.176 --> 00:21:03.680
Congressman Kang Young-seop
and Woo Jong-Gil,

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:06.642
ex-deputy prosecutor,
attended the ceremony.

00:21:14.483 --> 00:21:17.361
APPLICATION FOR RETRIAL

00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:31.041
I've worked as a prosecutor
for 8 years!

00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:34.044
Long enough to know
if it was a plot.

00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:37.798
I'm being made a scapegoat
to cover up the habitat case!

00:21:40.384 --> 00:21:43.136
The so-called witnesses
are all lying,

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:45.055
and Min-woo is acting
like a crazy man.

00:21:45.097 --> 00:21:47.558
It's like everyone
wants to bury me alive.

00:21:48.684 --> 00:21:49.560
So?

00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:51.270
The thing is...

00:21:53.814 --> 00:21:58.527
I'm absolutely sure that
Lee Jin-seok had his inhaler!

00:21:59.403 --> 00:22:01.363
If we can find it,
it would solve this case.

00:22:01.405 --> 00:22:05.617
Didn't you hear the testimony
that he never had asthma?

00:22:06.285 --> 00:22:08.161
You keep saying
the same damn thing!

00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:12.958
All the evidence
points to you as the murderer.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.838
Then what do you want me to do?

00:22:21.842 --> 00:22:24.386
First, plead guilty.

00:22:25.137 --> 00:22:29.683
Then we'll say the victim
acted rashly under interrogation,

00:22:30.225 --> 00:22:31.685
and claim self-defense.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.356
You want me to admit to this?

00:22:37.858 --> 00:22:39.151
Listen, Jae-wook.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.529
This isn't the truth
I'm talking about...

00:22:43.322 --> 00:22:44.990
it's the way of the law.

00:22:45.032 --> 00:22:45.908
Sir!

00:22:45.949 --> 00:22:49.912
This is the only way

00:22:52.039 --> 00:22:53.624
I can get you out of this.

00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:55.042
Now, the verdict.

00:22:55.709 --> 00:23:00.756
We recognize the defendant's
service to the cause of justice.

00:23:01.131 --> 00:23:04.760
But his abuse of power
leading to the victim's death

00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:09.181
is too serious a crime
to be forgiven.

00:23:09.473 --> 00:23:12.518
Furthermore, we find
no evidence to support

00:23:12.935 --> 00:23:15.312
the defendant's claim
of self-defense.

00:23:16.355 --> 00:23:20.692
Therefore, believing in
the need to raise an alarm

00:23:21.151 --> 00:23:25.822
over the illegal investigations
of the prosecution and police,

00:23:26.365 --> 00:23:29.660
we find the defendant guilty,

00:23:30.077 --> 00:23:35.082
and sentence him to
15 years in prison.

00:23:42.172 --> 00:23:44.967
Chief, this isn't
what you told me!

00:23:45.092 --> 00:23:46.802
What's going on?

00:23:46.844 --> 00:23:47.469
Chief!

00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:49.513
- Jae-wook, stop it!
- Chief!

00:23:49.555 --> 00:23:51.056
What the hell are you doing to me?

00:23:51.348 --> 00:23:52.391
Answer me!

00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:53.642
Let me go!

00:23:53.976 --> 00:23:56.144
Tell me why
you're doing this to me!

00:23:56.603 --> 00:23:58.313
Tell me!

00:23:58.814 --> 00:23:59.898
Let go of me!

00:24:00.148 --> 00:24:01.733
Woo Jong-Gil!
Damn it.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.402
Tell me the reason!

00:24:04.403 --> 00:24:05.946
Why did you do this to me!

00:24:13.912 --> 00:24:16.290
Yes, sir.

00:24:16.498 --> 00:24:18.458
I'll take care of it myself.

00:24:19.126 --> 00:24:22.212
Thank you.
I'm counting on you.

00:24:28.427 --> 00:24:29.678
No. 3820.

00:24:29.928 --> 00:24:31.471
Warden wants to see you.

00:24:55.495 --> 00:24:59.416
Every man in this jail
believes that he's innocent.

00:24:59.625 --> 00:25:02.211
Rather than upset people upstairs,

00:25:02.461 --> 00:25:05.881
you'd be better off
getting used to it here, okay?

00:25:17.434 --> 00:25:20.354
APPLICATION FOR RETRIAL

00:25:26.318 --> 00:25:28.820
It's cold. Let's hurry.

00:25:29.905 --> 00:25:31.323
Attention!

00:25:31.823 --> 00:25:33.075
Gather here.

00:25:36.495 --> 00:25:38.413
Raise your hand

00:25:38.497 --> 00:25:41.166
if any of you has experience
in real estate.

00:25:42.459 --> 00:25:44.294
What did you do?

00:25:44.378 --> 00:25:46.380
I was a contractor

00:25:46.421 --> 00:25:47.923
and illegal real-estate broker.

00:25:49.299 --> 00:25:51.468
It means you were a con-man!

00:25:54.137 --> 00:25:55.138
What did you do?

00:25:56.348 --> 00:25:57.933
The same broker?

00:25:57.975 --> 00:25:59.059
I'm sorry, sir.

00:25:59.309 --> 00:26:01.186
My enthusiasm got the best of me.

00:26:02.938 --> 00:26:05.399
I'm the idiot for expecting
anything out of you.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.276
Forget it.
Back to work!

00:26:09.862 --> 00:26:12.155
Not one guy here
who can help me.

00:26:12.573 --> 00:26:15.409
What'll I do?
It's quite a big lawsuit,

00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:17.911
and what do I know
about the law?

00:26:18.245 --> 00:26:20.497
- Captain Im.
- Who the hell is this?

00:26:20.581 --> 00:26:22.040
On the outside,

00:26:22.291 --> 00:26:24.918
I handled a few
real-estate disputes in court.

00:26:25.711 --> 00:26:28.213
That's right!
You're the one!

00:26:28.797 --> 00:26:30.757
Why didn't I think of you?

00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:33.510
We have a specialist here.

00:26:39.766 --> 00:26:41.977
So this would solve everything?

00:26:42.144 --> 00:26:44.438
- It's that simple?
- Yes, sir.

00:26:45.105 --> 00:26:47.107
Then the other party

00:26:47.649 --> 00:26:50.694
will be arrested for evasion
under property transfer law.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.865
So he'll offer you a settlement.

00:26:55.115 --> 00:26:58.285
Then you get your money back,
plus a cancellation fee.

00:27:01.079 --> 00:27:02.289
May I have one more?

00:27:02.331 --> 00:27:03.624
Of course, go ahead!

00:27:03.665 --> 00:27:05.250
Take your time.

00:27:05.292 --> 00:27:06.919
A while back,

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.172
I lost a civil suit to my uncle
so I need to pay.

00:27:10.214 --> 00:27:11.089
Yes, right.

00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:12.925
But as you know well,

00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:15.135
civil servants like us
have no money...

00:27:17.513 --> 00:27:19.638
- Don't pay him.
- Really?

00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:22.601
Is it okay not to?
The court ordered me to pay.

00:27:23.769 --> 00:27:26.271
What do those jerks know?

00:27:26.396 --> 00:27:28.524
I'll settle it for you.

00:27:32.152 --> 00:27:33.695
In return...

00:27:35.822 --> 00:27:37.366
could you do me a favor?

00:27:40.369 --> 00:27:42.287
Really nice, bro.

00:27:43.622 --> 00:27:45.582
You dance much better
than the pros!

00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:47.709
Nice move!

00:27:52.297 --> 00:27:54.967
No. 1322, you're transferred.

00:27:55.133 --> 00:27:56.635
Why all of a sudden?

00:27:58.053 --> 00:27:59.096
What is it?

00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:00.681
Wait!

00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:05.602
What is it?

00:28:07.938 --> 00:28:09.231
Why are you doing this?

00:28:10.482 --> 00:28:12.276
At least tell me the reason!

00:28:12.568 --> 00:28:14.987
Please tell me!

00:28:15.654 --> 00:28:17.739
Where the hell
are you sending me?

00:28:17.781 --> 00:28:20.701
At least tell me where!
Let me go!

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.874
Damn bastard, let me go!

00:28:30.586 --> 00:28:34.131
5 YEARS LATER

00:29:03.994 --> 00:29:05.120
Welcome!

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:07.414
Newbies!

00:29:07.664 --> 00:29:10.417
Good to meet you!
See you inside.

00:29:13.128 --> 00:29:15.297
Hey, don't stare at me!

00:29:18.842 --> 00:29:20.135
Left face!

00:29:20.844 --> 00:29:22.137
March ahead!

00:29:26.475 --> 00:29:27.809
See you soon.

00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:48.872
Honey, are you alright?
How do you feel?

00:29:49.289 --> 00:29:50.999
You're okay, right?

00:29:58.257 --> 00:29:59.716
Why are you saying that?

00:30:00.926 --> 00:30:03.637
You really don't know why?

00:30:04.137 --> 00:30:06.640
Honey, don't do this to me!

00:30:07.432 --> 00:30:12.563
I'm no longer good enough
for a sweet girl like you.

00:30:14.898 --> 00:30:19.278
Forget about an ex-con like me
and live a happy life.

00:30:21.697 --> 00:30:23.407
That's what I came out to say.

00:30:25.617 --> 00:30:26.827
Honey.

00:30:29.705 --> 00:30:31.164
I'm done with the visit!

00:30:31.206 --> 00:30:33.333
Wait, honey! Please!

00:30:42.426 --> 00:30:44.720
I know you don't belong here.

00:30:45.012 --> 00:30:47.181
I know it all.

00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:48.891
The person I know

00:30:49.057 --> 00:30:51.351
is too pure-hearted
and innocent for this!

00:30:51.351 --> 00:30:52.477
Stop it, Hanna.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.438
I'm stupid.

00:30:54.438 --> 00:30:55.898
I'm a fool!

00:30:56.148 --> 00:30:57.983
All I did in the US was study.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.152
I don't know
the ways of the world.

00:31:03.155 --> 00:31:05.282
I believed everything
Koreans told me.

00:31:05.365 --> 00:31:08.952
I think the world
misunderstood you.

00:31:08.994 --> 00:31:09.995
No!

00:31:10.454 --> 00:31:11.455
What misunderstanding?

00:31:11.455 --> 00:31:12.956
Don’t you see this?

00:31:12.956 --> 00:31:14.917
The world will never recognize me!

00:31:15.209 --> 00:31:17.461
Do you think your family

00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:21.423
will approve a scumbag like me?

00:31:21.465 --> 00:31:22.966
You're not a scumbag!

00:31:23.383 --> 00:31:25.260
I can overcome everything.

00:31:26.887 --> 00:31:31.892
My dad will give me
his new building.

00:31:32.518 --> 00:31:33.936
We can start small with it

00:31:34.353 --> 00:31:36.772
when you come out, okay?

00:31:41.985 --> 00:31:44.947
You're unbelievable.

00:31:46.323 --> 00:31:48.075
How did I ever find

00:31:50.035 --> 00:31:52.621
a girl like you
in this dirty world?

00:31:54.831 --> 00:31:55.958
Honey.

00:32:04.675 --> 00:32:06.802
- Get rid of all his gang.
- Yes, sir.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:32.369
Who was it?

00:32:32.411 --> 00:32:34.204
I heard a chick visited you.

00:32:34.913 --> 00:32:35.998
I envy you!

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.125
- Tell me the secret!
- Yeah, tell us!

00:32:40.252 --> 00:32:43.755
The difference between
you guys and me

00:32:43.964 --> 00:32:45.340
is that you think too much.

00:32:47.593 --> 00:32:52.556
Fraud is not about cheating
others and ruining them.

00:32:53.473 --> 00:32:55.100
It's leaving yourself behind.

00:32:55.767 --> 00:32:59.438
It's just making yourself into
the person you want to be.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.651
We brought him.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.614
Who the hell are they?

00:33:09.072 --> 00:33:11.867
You don't know?
He's the prosecutor in cell #9.

00:33:12.075 --> 00:33:14.161
Sir...

00:33:17.289 --> 00:33:19.124
I'm not a criminal.

00:33:20.125 --> 00:33:21.418
Then what are you?

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.879
One of my staff
raped my daughter.

00:33:24.171 --> 00:33:26.965
How could a father
turn his back on that?

00:33:27.799 --> 00:33:29.593
Don't look at me when you talk

00:33:30.177 --> 00:33:31.178
Pardon?

00:33:36.975 --> 00:33:40.062
So I called in several
Yanbian Koreans.

00:33:42.689 --> 00:33:44.441
So you are a criminal.

00:33:49.696 --> 00:33:50.739
Sir.

00:33:51.406 --> 00:33:53.992
I heard quite a lot about him.

00:33:54.618 --> 00:33:56.578
He's facing big difficulties now.

00:33:56.745 --> 00:33:58.205
But he has a great reputation.

00:33:58.247 --> 00:33:59.831
- Tell him to come.
- Yes.

00:34:00.582 --> 00:34:02.084
You can talk to his face now.

00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:03.836
Please help me, sir.

00:34:05.003 --> 00:34:09.633
Does the prosecutor have proof
that the Yanbian Koreans asked for money?

00:34:09.633 --> 00:34:10.759
No, sir.

00:34:11.468 --> 00:34:14.847
Then just find some other
Yanbian Koreans

00:34:15.013 --> 00:34:17.641
and make them testify
you didn't order them to kill him.

00:34:17.891 --> 00:34:19.226
Tell them to commit perjury?

00:34:19.268 --> 00:34:23.522
The prosecution can't confirm
arguments made from China.

00:34:23.647 --> 00:34:25.274
That's how the system works.

00:34:25.941 --> 00:34:28.777
If they just testify
you didn't order the killing,

00:34:29.152 --> 00:34:31.405
the sentence will be reduced
by 2 years.

00:34:32.322 --> 00:34:33.448
2 years?

00:34:34.032 --> 00:34:38.495
Plus, the court will consider
the rape victim's mental anguish.

00:34:40.539 --> 00:34:43.208
- How long have you been here?
- 9 months.

00:34:44.626 --> 00:34:46.044
9 months...

00:34:47.963 --> 00:34:49.631
Congratulations.
Only 3 months left.

00:34:50.132 --> 00:34:52.092
Really? Thank you!

00:34:52.259 --> 00:34:53.969
How can I express my gratitude?

00:34:54.011 --> 00:34:56.221
I'll tell you later if I need help.

00:34:56.972 --> 00:34:59.349
Thank you, sir.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.351
Thank you!

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.355
What's the use of
being a big shot in prison?

00:35:05.355 --> 00:35:07.065
He's just a murderer after all.

00:35:15.115 --> 00:35:16.867
Attention, everyone!

00:35:17.618 --> 00:35:19.995
Salute the warden!

00:35:20.787 --> 00:35:22.164
Hello, sir!

00:35:23.916 --> 00:35:24.917
At ease.

00:35:25.417 --> 00:35:27.920
Jae-wook,
why are you working?

00:35:29.171 --> 00:35:30.964
It's my duty to work.

00:35:31.256 --> 00:35:33.717
The case you mentioned before...

00:35:33.759 --> 00:35:35.177
how did it go?

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.472
Their lawyer was left speechless.

00:35:39.556 --> 00:35:40.766
Good to hear.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:42.601
- Hey!
- Yes, sir.

00:35:44.228 --> 00:35:46.438
Thank you sir
for the papers.

00:35:47.356 --> 00:35:49.149
- Let's have some coffee.
- Yes, sir.

00:35:51.902 --> 00:35:53.612
Keep up the good work!

00:35:53.654 --> 00:35:55.030
Yes, sir!

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:02.371
Nice!

00:36:27.104 --> 00:36:28.188
Hey, here!

00:36:34.987 --> 00:36:35.988
Guys.

00:36:36.488 --> 00:36:38.365
Keep it quiet, okay?

00:36:38.824 --> 00:36:40.367
- Yes.
- Yes, bro.

00:36:41.618 --> 00:36:42.703
What the hell?

00:36:44.663 --> 00:36:46.915
Why do people smoke that crap?

00:36:50.127 --> 00:36:51.712
You know what, bro?

00:36:51.837 --> 00:36:52.838
Tell me.

00:36:53.046 --> 00:36:57.342
Once migratory birds leave Russia,
they keep flying for 15 days

00:36:57.968 --> 00:37:00.470
without landing or eating.

00:37:01.305 --> 00:37:02.598
You know what, prosecutor?

00:37:03.307 --> 00:37:05.184
Once migratory birds leave Russia,

00:37:05.225 --> 00:37:07.019
they keep flying for 15 days

00:37:07.186 --> 00:37:09.521
without landing or eating...

00:37:12.816 --> 00:37:14.109
The bird sanctuary is the place...

00:37:14.151 --> 00:37:16.695
Those birds use that place
like a rest area.

00:37:16.737 --> 00:37:19.865
So they eat, drink,
take a rest.

00:37:19.907 --> 00:37:22.201
Then they fly on
to the South Pacific.

00:37:25.287 --> 00:37:26.872
Where did you hear that?

00:37:27.998 --> 00:37:29.583
Who are you?

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.251
What the...

00:37:32.961 --> 00:37:35.923
That kind of migratory bird...
Where did you hear it?

00:37:35.923 --> 00:37:37.132
Are you crazy?

00:37:37.132 --> 00:37:37.508
Hey

00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:38.592
What is it?

00:37:42.387 --> 00:37:45.641
It's really important to me,
so tell me straight.

00:37:47.351 --> 00:37:48.852
Don’t touch, man.

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.271
What's wrong with him?

00:37:53.315 --> 00:37:55.108
Tell me now, damn it!

00:37:57.277 --> 00:37:59.905
Mister, I'm from the States

00:38:00.239 --> 00:38:02.658
and we care a lot about nature.

00:38:02.699 --> 00:38:05.577
In Pennsylvania, if you pollute,
you get the death penalty.

00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:07.120
You know nothing.

00:38:11.875 --> 00:38:13.377
I love birds!

00:38:14.211 --> 00:38:15.712
My favorite, right?

00:38:21.385 --> 00:38:22.886
Take it easy, man.

00:38:25.472 --> 00:38:26.849
Damn bastard...

00:38:32.729 --> 00:38:35.941
Even if you appeal,
you can't win.

00:38:35.983 --> 00:38:37.568
You'd better serve your sentence.

00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:39.987
Sign here and let's wrap this up.

00:38:41.238 --> 00:38:43.949
Anniversary of my father's death
is next month.

00:38:44.867 --> 00:38:47.244
My mother and
younger brother need me.

00:38:48.579 --> 00:38:51.540
I need to work
to feed my family.

00:38:51.748 --> 00:38:53.750
Mr. Han Chi-won,

00:38:54.376 --> 00:38:57.546
you lied about graduating
from Penn State!

00:38:57.588 --> 00:39:01.425
Sir, they were falling over
themselves trying to invest,

00:39:01.425 --> 00:39:03.135
should I just ignore them?

00:39:03.427 --> 00:39:05.012
If you see cash
lying in the street,

00:39:05.053 --> 00:39:07.681
do you just say, 'Oh, money...'
and leave it there?

00:39:09.016 --> 00:39:11.894
It's true, I'm a materialist.

00:39:18.317 --> 00:39:20.360
- You're a public defender?
- Yes.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.862
Which class?

00:39:22.446 --> 00:39:23.655
The 38th.

00:39:23.906 --> 00:39:25.657
Oh, you passed a bit late.

00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:27.367
I'm from 31st class.

00:39:27.701 --> 00:39:30.954
Oh, it's you... sir.

00:39:31.538 --> 00:39:32.956
Please sit.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:35.292
- I'll take a look at the file.
- Pardon?

00:39:35.292 --> 00:39:37.211
- It's a really simple case.
- What is it?

00:39:38.712 --> 00:39:41.131
Refer to the Supreme Court's
precedent of 1998.

00:39:41.507 --> 00:39:42.799
What do you think you're doing?

00:39:42.841 --> 00:39:47.304
It sets out legal principles
for the causal relationship

00:39:47.346 --> 00:39:49.473
between fraud and damage.

00:39:50.641 --> 00:39:51.725
In other words,

00:39:51.767 --> 00:39:53.852
if there is no clear
causal relationship

00:39:53.894 --> 00:39:56.271
between fraud and damage,

00:39:56.813 --> 00:39:59.399
charges of fraud
cannot be established.

00:40:08.242 --> 00:40:09.910
What are you doing?

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.995
What is this crazy bastard saying?

00:40:12.204 --> 00:40:13.330
You wait here.

00:40:14.873 --> 00:40:15.999
Sir...

00:40:42.568 --> 00:40:43.569
Sit down.

00:40:51.243 --> 00:40:52.578
Mr. Pennsylvania!

00:40:53.537 --> 00:40:57.082
So, where did you hear
the story about the birds?

00:40:57.583 --> 00:40:58.834
Oh, that?

00:40:59.334 --> 00:41:00.794
I told you already.

00:41:04.339 --> 00:41:05.716
Be straight with me.

00:41:07.301 --> 00:41:11.430
I know you've never
been on an airplane in your life

00:41:12.055 --> 00:41:14.308
and you've been convicted
10 times already

00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:17.102
for swindling dumb girls.

00:41:17.269 --> 00:41:19.313
What the hell
are you talking about?

00:41:20.731 --> 00:41:21.899
9 times.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.609
I was acquitted once last year.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.402
If your story

00:41:26.486 --> 00:41:28.530
is the thing I'm looking for,

00:41:30.949 --> 00:41:34.995
I can get you out of here
right away.

00:41:46.507 --> 00:41:47.466
Just a moment.

00:41:51.887 --> 00:41:53.055
Okay!

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.058
What do you want?

00:41:59.228 --> 00:42:01.188
Maybe 5 years ago...?

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.358
I heard I could get paid
100 bucks per day

00:42:04.399 --> 00:42:06.735
for studying at
some kind of service company.

00:42:07.402 --> 00:42:10.447
Back then I was preparing
for my own business...

00:42:10.489 --> 00:42:12.241
so I went there to kill time.

00:42:12.741 --> 00:42:15.077
There were about 20 guys...

00:42:15.077 --> 00:42:18.705
who spoke well and looked
relatively innocent for this field.

00:42:19.665 --> 00:42:22.209
It was nice to get paid
for learning something.

00:42:23.252 --> 00:42:25.671
But one day
they took us somewhere.

00:42:25.921 --> 00:42:30.133
They gave us iron pipes
and told us to attack the police.

00:42:32.427 --> 00:42:35.097
I'd never hit anyone in my life,

00:42:35.472 --> 00:42:36.932
so I couldn't do it.

00:42:39.434 --> 00:42:42.104
I never imagined
it would be that brutal.

00:42:43.272 --> 00:42:44.940
The person
who gave you the order

00:42:46.775 --> 00:42:48.485
was Jang Hyun-seok of
Far East Construction.

00:42:49.361 --> 00:42:50.362
Huh?

00:42:50.696 --> 00:42:52.155
How do you know his name?

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.578
Scumbags like you
are the ones I hate most.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.122
Parasites who exploit others.

00:43:02.749 --> 00:43:04.084
But this time,

00:43:05.127 --> 00:43:07.087
even if you don't want to

00:43:07.921 --> 00:43:10.174
I'll definitely
get you out of here.

00:43:24.021 --> 00:43:25.022
Listen.

00:43:25.564 --> 00:43:28.942
From now on, you need to
face those you fear most.

00:43:30.194 --> 00:43:31.278
Gangsters.

00:43:35.866 --> 00:43:37.701
- Come on in.
- Yes, sir.

00:43:39.703 --> 00:43:40.704
Prosecutors.

00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:42.623
- Good day, chief.
- Hello.

00:43:47.002 --> 00:43:48.045
Politicians.

00:43:48.295 --> 00:43:52.633
Today I leave behind
the prosecutor's office

00:43:52.633 --> 00:43:54.885
to which I dedicated my youth,

00:43:54.885 --> 00:43:57.721
and start my second life
as a politician!

00:43:58.639 --> 00:44:00.057
Pennsylvania

00:44:19.451 --> 00:44:21.662
Hey, copy that signature!

00:44:32.881 --> 00:44:34.716
Why should I copy that,
all of a sudden?

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:36.969
Don't try to learn the details.

00:44:37.886 --> 00:44:40.222
Just practice
signing exactly the same.

00:44:40.389 --> 00:44:42.266
You'll need it in the future.

00:45:16.425 --> 00:45:18.010
GO FOR IT!

00:45:57.883 --> 00:46:00.302
They should get a dryer,
damn it.

00:46:00.344 --> 00:46:02.221
- Hang it there.
- Yes.

00:46:04.389 --> 00:46:05.557
Hi, bro.

00:46:06.308 --> 00:46:07.476
Easter eggs!

00:46:08.852 --> 00:46:10.020
I love you.

00:46:10.437 --> 00:46:12.648
Crazy bastard.
Give those to me.

00:46:12.689 --> 00:46:14.191
- Give 'em to me!
- Why?

00:46:14.233 --> 00:46:15.359
Just give them!

00:46:16.944 --> 00:46:19.154
Hey, Young-cheol.
Share this with the others.

00:46:19.613 --> 00:46:21.532
Thank you so much, sir.

00:46:22.866 --> 00:46:24.451
Guys, let's have some eggs!

00:46:24.785 --> 00:46:27.913
You're good looking
and quite smart.

00:46:27.955 --> 00:46:29.706
Why'd you become a con-man?

00:46:30.332 --> 00:46:31.792
You might not know this...

00:46:31.834 --> 00:46:34.378
I once placed 38th
nationwide in a mock SAT.

00:46:34.753 --> 00:46:37.631
But my father passed away,
and I got all his debts.

00:46:37.798 --> 00:46:39.550
What could I do?

00:46:40.092 --> 00:46:43.512
Nothing to do except to
use this face and brain.

00:46:45.806 --> 00:46:48.559
From my point of view,
are you a bad guy or not?

00:46:50.602 --> 00:46:51.603
I guess not.

00:46:51.854 --> 00:46:52.938
Go to hell.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.691
Once this is over,
live your life right.

00:46:56.316 --> 00:46:58.527
Yes, understood, bro!

00:47:00.362 --> 00:47:01.363
Bro?

00:47:10.038 --> 00:47:11.081
By the way...

00:47:11.331 --> 00:47:13.834
why does no one
come to see you?

00:47:17.462 --> 00:47:20.132
Guess I was a bad guy
on the outside.

00:47:21.967 --> 00:47:24.469
You must be married.
How about kids?

00:47:27.639 --> 00:47:28.765
You're not?

00:47:29.808 --> 00:47:33.645
You totally look married!
What kind of life did you lead?

00:47:34.396 --> 00:47:35.397
Gosh!

00:47:44.198 --> 00:47:45.616
Now, my verdict.

00:47:46.033 --> 00:47:48.202
Reflecting the Supreme
Court's precedent,

00:47:48.577 --> 00:47:51.038
it is hard to see
that the defendant

00:47:51.246 --> 00:47:54.499
showed a willingness to swindle
the victim out of money

00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:56.752
so there is no case for fraud.

00:47:57.294 --> 00:48:00.255
So the court revokes
the original verdict

00:48:00.756 --> 00:48:03.759
and declares the defendant
not guilty.

00:48:10.224 --> 00:48:11.725
Congratulations, Chi-won.

00:48:20.108 --> 00:48:21.109
Sir!

00:48:22.611 --> 00:48:23.987
I'm going out tomorrow!

00:48:24.404 --> 00:48:25.489
Happy?

00:48:26.573 --> 00:48:28.367
Don't smile.
Sit!

00:48:37.918 --> 00:48:39.002
What's this?

00:48:39.127 --> 00:48:41.797
The numbers of the perjurers
at my trial 5 years ago.

00:48:44.508 --> 00:48:46.510
Don't waste your time
on useless crap.

00:48:46.552 --> 00:48:47.970
Focus on the work I give you.

00:48:48.136 --> 00:48:49.429
Hey...

00:48:53.308 --> 00:48:55.644
I promise that
I will do my best

00:48:55.853 --> 00:48:57.646
to resolve your pain.

00:48:58.564 --> 00:49:00.440
What a fool...

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.068
Don't overdo it!

00:49:09.783 --> 00:49:10.951
Let's get back to work!

00:49:11.034 --> 00:49:11.785
Let's get back to work!

00:49:11.827 --> 00:49:12.953
Let's go!

00:49:13.871 --> 00:49:14.952
What's next?

00:49:15.038 --> 00:49:18.375
- Beat it, you're bugging me.
- I know you like it.

00:49:18.834 --> 00:49:20.836
This is why
you don't have a wife.

00:49:22.129 --> 00:49:23.672
I said beat it!

00:49:32.347 --> 00:49:33.640
Hello, who is it?

00:49:33.807 --> 00:49:36.727
It's me, Han Chi-won.

00:49:37.102 --> 00:49:38.270
Han Chi-won?

00:49:38.854 --> 00:49:41.481
I thought you were dead!
What brings you here?

00:49:43.275 --> 00:49:44.985
Take it slow.

00:49:45.944 --> 00:49:47.738
Do the bosses not feed you?

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.781
Guess you're on a roll.

00:49:49.781 --> 00:49:51.658
You look so nice and shiny.

00:49:51.783 --> 00:49:53.702
You know I use my brain.

00:49:53.744 --> 00:49:55.787
- I can't go wrong.
- Really?

00:49:58.123 --> 00:50:01.293
But where are the brainy ones?

00:50:01.543 --> 00:50:03.504
Busy with the election campaign.

00:50:04.213 --> 00:50:06.381
Lots of deliveries to make.

00:50:06.381 --> 00:50:09.426
Guys like us just get
chewed out all the time.

00:50:11.011 --> 00:50:13.472
Sir, I'm thankful for the meal

00:50:13.514 --> 00:50:15.974
and happy for your success.

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.143
Please propose a toast.

00:50:18.185 --> 00:50:20.020
- Stop it.
- Please!

00:50:20.062 --> 00:50:21.438
Give him a big hand!

00:50:23.357 --> 00:50:25.442
It's embarrassing.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:30.322
Here, to your health
and lots of money!

00:50:30.781 --> 00:50:32.616
Most of all, to life!
Cheers!

00:50:33.575 --> 00:50:34.910
Cheers!

00:50:37.579 --> 00:50:38.872
He looks handsome!

00:50:44.461 --> 00:50:45.587
Buddy.

00:50:46.547 --> 00:50:48.131
Let's toast, after so long.

00:50:48.799 --> 00:50:49.842
Sure.

00:50:56.682 --> 00:50:59.059
I heard that Jin-seok died.

00:51:00.143 --> 00:51:02.229
I was abroad for a long time

00:51:02.855 --> 00:51:04.398
so couldn't attend his funeral.

00:51:05.858 --> 00:51:08.569
Stop it!
That was ages ago!

00:51:10.237 --> 00:51:14.241
- Madam! 5 more plates!
- Coming!

00:51:16.076 --> 00:51:19.079
And I heard that...

00:51:19.204 --> 00:51:22.040
he was beaten to death
by this crazy prosecutor.

00:51:25.419 --> 00:51:26.545
Hey!

00:51:26.587 --> 00:51:29.173
Why do you keep talking
about the dead?

00:51:30.507 --> 00:51:31.133
My bad.

00:51:31.175 --> 00:51:32.926
I'm losing my appetite.

00:51:40.475 --> 00:51:42.060
I'll try harder, boss.

00:51:44.605 --> 00:51:46.356
Let's go second round!

00:51:47.858 --> 00:51:49.568
Second round!

00:51:56.366 --> 00:51:57.993
- Look.
- Why?

00:51:58.035 --> 00:52:00.245
Think about it.

00:52:01.288 --> 00:52:04.833
What on earth have you gotten
for working so hard so far?

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:07.920
If this greasy pork

00:52:08.504 --> 00:52:11.256
gives you a heart attack,
then what?

00:52:12.341 --> 00:52:14.927
I was an athlete
in my high school days,

00:52:14.968 --> 00:52:17.095
and I only weighed 60 kg.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.558
But doing my job
while eating that fodder...

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:26.438
But at least

00:52:27.272 --> 00:52:29.107
we should be grateful
that we're alive like this.

00:52:29.149 --> 00:52:31.276
So we can
drink together now!

00:52:32.402 --> 00:52:33.820
Look at Jin-seok.

00:52:33.862 --> 00:52:35.280
What kind of life is that?

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:39.826
Damn poor bastard.

00:52:41.703 --> 00:52:44.373
He could never
even breathe properly.

00:52:45.582 --> 00:52:47.292
We always teased him.

00:52:49.127 --> 00:52:53.006
Then... was he sick
in the first place?

00:52:53.215 --> 00:52:56.468
You didn't know?
His asthma was really serious!

00:52:57.803 --> 00:52:59.763
What? Asthma?

00:53:03.141 --> 00:53:05.185
You knew he had asthma?

00:53:05.519 --> 00:53:07.396
Sure.

00:53:07.521 --> 00:53:09.565
Everyone knew about it.
Why do you ask?

00:53:09.982 --> 00:53:11.233
You didn't know?

00:53:11.275 --> 00:53:12.818
I didn't.

00:53:15.237 --> 00:53:17.406
How could he...

00:53:23.745 --> 00:53:24.788
My friend.

00:53:25.664 --> 00:53:26.790
Let's drink.

00:53:46.518 --> 00:53:48.270
Can I have one?

00:53:50.397 --> 00:53:51.398
Thank you.

00:54:22.763 --> 00:54:24.014
What I mean is...

00:54:24.389 --> 00:54:26.975
if Jin-seok started to talk the crap

00:54:27.935 --> 00:54:30.395
it could've ruined
the boss' business.

00:54:32.064 --> 00:54:33.106
Right.

00:54:33.148 --> 00:54:35.526
That's what I mean!

00:54:37.027 --> 00:54:39.863
- So the boss did it to him?
- Right.

00:54:41.532 --> 00:54:45.282
The boss ordered Jin-seok killed.

00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:51.291
So you're saying it's not
the prosecutor who did it.

00:54:51.333 --> 00:54:52.960
Right?

00:54:53.001 --> 00:54:53.919
I got it all right.

00:54:53.961 --> 00:54:55.087
APPLICATION FOR A RETRIAL

00:54:56.547 --> 00:54:57.548
Thank you.

00:55:03.136 --> 00:55:06.515
That's why I lied in court.

00:55:09.226 --> 00:55:12.020
We just did as the boss ordered.
Damn that's hot!

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.273
Oh! Are you okay?

00:55:14.314 --> 00:55:16.233
Are you crazy?
You bastard!

00:55:24.199 --> 00:55:26.577
It turned out really nice!

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:28.537
Son of Pohang...

00:55:28.996 --> 00:55:31.874
To be precise,
I'm not from Pohang.

00:55:32.249 --> 00:55:34.877
Don't say that again!

00:55:35.043 --> 00:55:37.713
For a politician,
your precinct is your hometown.

00:55:37.754 --> 00:55:38.922
Yes, sir.

00:55:44.511 --> 00:55:47.264
Oh, Jang. Make it quick.
I'm a bit busy now.

00:55:47.514 --> 00:55:50.058
Sir, have you heard?

00:55:50.225 --> 00:55:51.226
Heard what?

00:55:52.102 --> 00:55:54.354
Byun Jae-wook applied for a retrial.

00:55:54.813 --> 00:55:58.358
I think one of my boys
might've said something...

00:55:58.358 --> 00:56:00.319
I'm afraid
something could go wrong.

00:56:00.652 --> 00:56:02.779
Don't talk about this
on the phone.

00:56:04.448 --> 00:56:05.365
Where are you now?

00:56:05.365 --> 00:56:08.452
Are you out of your minds,
you bloody bastards?

00:56:08.994 --> 00:56:11.914
How long do I have to do this?

00:56:12.581 --> 00:56:13.790
You damn bastards!

00:56:20.839 --> 00:56:22.090
You guys wait outside.

00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:36.939
- Sir.
- Mr. Jang.

00:56:38.357 --> 00:56:41.443
Since becoming a prosecutor,
I developed a daily routine.

00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:44.404
- You know what it is?
- Pardon?

00:56:45.864 --> 00:56:46.990
Don't know sir.

00:56:47.282 --> 00:56:49.743
I meditate for an hour
every morning.

00:56:50.661 --> 00:56:53.872
Doing that clears my head

00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:57.292
and I can see clearly
what I couldn't before.

00:56:57.501 --> 00:56:59.670
You see what?

00:57:00.796 --> 00:57:03.799
I can see, among those
who beg under my feet,

00:57:04.925 --> 00:57:07.636
who will backstab me someday.

00:57:09.596 --> 00:57:10.639
I'm sorry, sir.

00:57:11.849 --> 00:57:13.183
Look at you...

00:57:13.559 --> 00:57:18.689
I turned a reckless moron
into a businessman!

00:57:19.398 --> 00:57:22.442
And you pay me back
with this kind of a mess?

00:57:25.028 --> 00:57:26.029
Sir!

00:57:27.155 --> 00:57:28.949
I understand
you are not satisfied

00:57:29.616 --> 00:57:31.451
but I tried my best for you...

00:57:49.178 --> 00:57:50.971
Only a month until the election.

00:57:52.389 --> 00:57:53.724
Let's get it right.

00:57:58.103 --> 00:57:59.438
And call me often!

00:58:13.327 --> 00:58:14.328
Yes, sir.

00:58:15.537 --> 00:58:17.122
We've got the slippery one.

00:58:17.122 --> 00:58:19.166
Okay. Good job.

00:58:20.125 --> 00:58:21.585
You wrap it up on your own.

00:58:21.627 --> 00:58:23.837
What do you mean
by wrapping it up?

00:58:24.463 --> 00:58:25.589
You stupid brat.

00:58:25.756 --> 00:58:27.549
Whether you scare him
into silence,

00:58:27.674 --> 00:58:29.510
or beat him senseless,

00:58:29.635 --> 00:58:30.969
I don't care.

00:58:31.011 --> 00:58:33.388
I just want you to handle it

00:58:34.139 --> 00:58:35.849
and report me the result!

00:58:36.725 --> 00:58:38.852
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

00:58:49.613 --> 00:58:53.450
- Hello, sir!
- Long time no see, Min-woo!

00:58:54.409 --> 00:58:57.120
You've been on the
up and up nowadays!

00:58:57.162 --> 00:58:58.956
You look a bit exhausted.

00:58:59.081 --> 00:59:00.999
Don't enter politics.

00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:04.378
It's quite tough.

00:59:07.548 --> 00:59:09.842
Did something happen?

00:59:12.886 --> 00:59:14.888
Well... I heard

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:17.474
Byun Jae-wook appealed.

00:59:17.891 --> 00:59:19.017
Pardon?

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:23.730
I'm afraid it might stir up gossip
right before the election.

00:59:23.856 --> 00:59:26.608
Why so suddenly?

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:29.903
This is perfect timing
to put a dent in my career.

00:59:31.154 --> 00:59:34.700
It's been a while
since you met your friend.

00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:37.244
You go and meet him.

00:59:38.912 --> 00:59:41.707
The trial can wait...

00:59:43.041 --> 00:59:44.626
until the election is over.

00:59:51.008 --> 00:59:53.302
Wow, you've changed a lot!

00:59:53.886 --> 00:59:55.220
You grew a beard?

00:59:57.598 --> 01:00:01.185
Let us talk in private.

01:00:03.061 --> 01:00:06.356
And I assume it's okay to smoke?

01:00:07.482 --> 01:00:08.650
Well, yes, sir.

01:00:17.576 --> 01:00:18.577
Have one.

01:00:19.077 --> 01:00:21.496
It's hard to get
one of these here.

01:00:30.088 --> 01:00:32.216
I don't know
what's on your mind.

01:00:32.466 --> 01:00:35.135
But if you are trying to
raise hay to sabotage us,

01:00:35.219 --> 01:00:36.345
I warn you to stop.

01:00:40.474 --> 01:00:42.434
You came all the way
to tell me this?

01:00:42.643 --> 01:00:45.687
You know well
there'll be no retrial

01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:47.648
with one piece of evidence.

01:00:49.608 --> 01:00:51.193
Wow...

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:54.571
Now you talk like a prosecutor.

01:00:55.322 --> 01:00:57.115
Finally learned
how to threaten.

01:00:57.366 --> 01:00:58.659
Don't be sarcastic.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.621
For 20 years since high school
I smoked 3 packs a day.

01:01:02.663 --> 01:01:04.873
But I quit five years ago.

01:01:05.332 --> 01:01:08.669
My head's never been clearer
in my whole life.

01:01:10.671 --> 01:01:12.339
Take care.

01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.387
Give Woo my best regards.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.311
Ruthless bastards...

01:01:45.497 --> 01:01:46.832
I'm sorry, pal.

01:01:49.376 --> 01:01:52.462
Did you convince him to testify?

01:01:52.504 --> 01:01:54.006
He's all smashed up.

01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:56.842
He might live the rest of
his life half-paralyzed.

01:01:58.343 --> 01:01:59.011
Damn...you're okay?

01:01:59.052 --> 01:02:01.513
Wouldn't be talking to you
if I were caught.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.975
Might be drowned or in pieces
at the bottom of some lake.

01:02:05.058 --> 01:02:07.561
Let's talk more face to face.

01:02:07.603 --> 01:02:08.979
Come meet me.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:10.981
Sir.

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:13.609
I gave it a lot of thought.

01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:17.529
I think I paid you back
for what you've done for me.

01:02:18.322 --> 01:02:20.157
Please don't call anymore.

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.673
Hanna told me

01:02:36.715 --> 01:02:39.259
you two would like to run
a small business.

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:41.845
Isn't it too humble for you

01:02:41.887 --> 01:02:43.847
after all your studies
in the States?

01:02:44.556 --> 01:02:47.392
We can start small first.

01:02:47.976 --> 01:02:49.853
My folks also started

01:02:49.895 --> 01:02:52.481
with a small gas station
in the US.

01:02:54.733 --> 01:02:56.527
You went to Penn, right?

01:02:56.568 --> 01:02:57.611
Yes!

01:02:58.278 --> 01:03:00.072
I studied business administration.

01:03:00.322 --> 01:03:01.406
Did you?

01:03:01.782 --> 01:03:05.118
They don't have that department.

01:03:08.372 --> 01:03:09.623
I mean the graduate school.

01:03:09.831 --> 01:03:12.125
Ah, you went to Wharton?

01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:14.169
One of my friends
studied there, too.

01:03:14.211 --> 01:03:16.922
Is that so?

01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:19.633
Are you talking about Kyung-min?

01:03:20.133 --> 01:03:21.635
That's right.

01:03:21.844 --> 01:03:24.429
He's your age,
he must've studied with you.

01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:27.804
You must know each other.
Not many Koreans at that school.

01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:29.184
Right, Kyung-min...

01:03:29.226 --> 01:03:32.104
The tall thin guy
who's good at basketball.

01:03:32.896 --> 01:03:35.107
He's not even 170cm.

01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:41.280
Sorry, I confused him
with another friend.

01:03:41.989 --> 01:03:43.323
Let me see... Kyung-min...

01:03:46.368 --> 01:03:49.329
Honey, my brother told me

01:03:49.454 --> 01:03:52.165
you talk like a person
from Gyeongsang Province.

01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:55.335
Gyeongsang Province?

01:03:59.506 --> 01:04:01.925
Is it near Busan?

01:04:04.094 --> 01:04:05.345
I don't really know

01:04:05.387 --> 01:04:09.600
but some say a Penn accent
sounds quite similar

01:04:09.641 --> 01:04:11.226
to Gyeongsang dialect.

01:04:11.351 --> 01:04:12.978
Does it?

01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:15.606
But I should have
a chat with him.

01:04:16.523 --> 01:04:19.484
Calling an American
a Gyeongsang hillbilly.

01:04:30.746 --> 01:04:32.206
Why isn't it moving?

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.921
Hello?

01:04:39.588 --> 01:04:40.589
Excuse me?

01:04:47.596 --> 01:04:48.680
Excuse me.

01:04:50.641 --> 01:04:51.642
Damn.

01:04:53.227 --> 01:04:54.478
Why are you doing this?

01:04:55.521 --> 01:04:56.522
I'm sorry.

01:04:58.524 --> 01:04:59.983
No...not my face!

01:05:01.735 --> 01:05:02.736
What is it?

01:05:03.278 --> 01:05:04.363
Oh my god.

01:05:05.906 --> 01:05:07.282
What are you guys?

01:05:07.282 --> 01:05:08.951
- Hey!
- It's alright.

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:10.160
Who are you anyway?

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.411
Hands off me!

01:05:11.453 --> 01:05:12.704
Are you crazy?

01:05:18.043 --> 01:05:19.294
Listen, Han Chi-won.

01:05:20.462 --> 01:05:23.090
Shall I tell your chick
you're a high school drop-out

01:05:23.131 --> 01:05:24.383
with nine convictions?

01:05:27.386 --> 01:05:29.805
You still need to pay him back.

01:06:00.544 --> 01:06:02.713
You said you won't see me.
What brings you here?

01:06:03.547 --> 01:06:05.090
Hey.

01:06:06.133 --> 01:06:10.012
See what you've done
to a class A masterpiece?

01:06:10.554 --> 01:06:12.347
Why are you doing this to me?

01:06:16.435 --> 01:06:18.395
Even if you leave me,

01:06:19.771 --> 01:06:22.024
Woo will kill you anyway.

01:06:25.569 --> 01:06:29.114
Are you crazy or what?

01:06:31.158 --> 01:06:34.036
You think I'm so weak?

01:06:35.913 --> 01:06:39.416
If you want to live rest of your life
on the run, suit yourself.

01:06:42.628 --> 01:06:44.213
Sir! Hello!

01:06:46.006 --> 01:06:47.382
Wait a sec!

01:06:56.934 --> 01:06:59.353
So what do you want me to do?

01:07:01.146 --> 01:07:04.691
Tell me.
You have no other option either.

01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:10.155
Can I trust you?

01:07:11.823 --> 01:07:14.243
It's just too hard.

01:07:14.284 --> 01:07:15.744
It's killing me.

01:07:15.786 --> 01:07:18.163
I want to get it done ASAP

01:07:19.331 --> 01:07:22.626
and return home to grow
some garlic with my old man.

01:07:22.668 --> 01:07:25.629
Didn't you say you lost
your father in junior high?

01:07:33.595 --> 01:07:34.721
Did I?

01:07:34.847 --> 01:07:40.056
I have dedicated 25 years
of my life to the law!

01:07:40.602 --> 01:07:42.646
Now, I will devote myself

01:07:42.688 --> 01:07:47.276
solely to my hometown, Pohang!

01:07:50.904 --> 01:07:55.284
As the returned son
of Pohang,

01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:57.578
please accept a big bow
from me,

01:07:57.619 --> 01:08:00.914
to the respected citizens
of my dear city!

01:08:06.253 --> 01:08:09.131
Woo Jong-Gil! Woo Jong-Gil!

01:08:09.339 --> 01:08:12.176
Woo Jong-Gil for Congress!

01:08:13.177 --> 01:08:15.387
Please give us some music!

01:08:18.182 --> 01:08:21.768
Please remember,
Candidate No.1 Woo Jong-Gil.

01:08:22.227 --> 01:08:23.687
Dear citizens of Pohang!

01:08:23.729 --> 01:08:27.316
Give a hand to Woo Jong-Gil.

01:08:28.483 --> 01:08:32.070
And let us offer you

01:08:32.362 --> 01:08:34.573
some campaign fun!

01:08:34.615 --> 01:08:37.451
Make some noise, please!

01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:42.998
Your energy must've
pumped him up hard.

01:08:43.415 --> 01:08:45.709
Look at his moves!

01:08:48.879 --> 01:08:50.464
He sure can dance!

01:08:50.881 --> 01:08:53.509
Look at her,
she feels the rhythm, too.

01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:57.513
Let's enjoy it together!
Ho ho ho!

01:09:03.977 --> 01:09:05.145
Great!

01:09:05.604 --> 01:09:07.022
Let's feel it!

01:09:10.442 --> 01:09:12.694
Wow.
Good job, ma'am.

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.821
Thank you
for the hard work.

01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:17.866
Look who's here.

01:09:18.742 --> 01:09:21.036
This young man knows
how to cheer up a crowd.

01:09:21.078 --> 01:09:23.121
I will do my best for you!

01:09:23.163 --> 01:09:24.331
Thank you.

01:09:24.706 --> 01:09:27.918
Would you mind if
I take a picture with you?

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.753
- Not at all, go ahead!
- Thank you, sir!

01:09:37.177 --> 01:09:38.178
It's an honor, sir!

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:39.471
Thank you everyone!

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.764
Woo Jong-Gil for Congress!

01:09:40.806 --> 01:09:41.557
Way to go!

01:09:41.598 --> 01:09:43.851
Woo Jong-Gil!
Woo Jong-Gil!

01:09:45.811 --> 01:09:48.814
Such a pretty young man.

01:09:49.273 --> 01:09:50.524
Are you a student?

01:09:50.858 --> 01:09:52.985
Yes, just finished
military service.

01:09:53.026 --> 01:09:55.028
I'm trying out things
before going back to school.

01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:56.697
What other things do you do?

01:09:56.947 --> 01:09:58.740
I tutor a few students.

01:09:58.782 --> 01:10:01.785
You must be
really good at studying!

01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:03.996
What university?

01:10:05.205 --> 01:10:09.293
In Seoul...begins with an S...

01:10:09.626 --> 01:10:12.838
Holy cow! You're too good
for this kind of thing.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.841
Such an outstanding talent!

01:10:16.049 --> 01:10:18.802
Your mom must be proud of you.
I envy her.

01:10:18.927 --> 01:10:21.138
I wish I had a son like you.

01:10:21.513 --> 01:10:25.017
Wait!
How do you fancy Yuna?

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:30.522
I guess you two could
make a good couple.

01:10:31.273 --> 01:10:32.649
He's studying at
Seoul University!

01:10:32.691 --> 01:10:34.610
Stop it, ma'am.

01:10:36.153 --> 01:10:40.282
I have a boyfriend...
Though he's in the army.

01:10:45.454 --> 01:10:47.372
- Thank you all.
- Good night, sir.

01:10:47.539 --> 01:10:48.540
See you tomorrow.

01:10:48.665 --> 01:10:49.750
Thank you.

01:11:01.637 --> 01:11:03.222
No, not here...

01:11:03.263 --> 01:11:04.681
It's okay, don't worry.

01:11:40.133 --> 01:11:43.804
'Woo Jong-Gil list' with
names of 11 big shots

01:11:49.268 --> 01:11:51.603
Source of campaign funds
revealed in bribe book

01:12:11.164 --> 01:12:14.126
Appeal to dismiss charges
against an ex-prosecutor

01:12:14.626 --> 01:12:16.170
serving time for homicide.

01:12:17.713 --> 01:12:18.630
This is big.

01:12:18.714 --> 01:12:22.509
Raising a fuss 5 years later
for a case he can't win,

01:12:23.177 --> 01:12:25.304
it's for manipulating
the media, your honor.

01:12:25.345 --> 01:12:27.097
Listen, Byun Jae-wook.

01:12:27.806 --> 01:12:29.808
Are you just doing this
to cause trouble?

01:12:29.808 --> 01:12:34.104
Didn't you hear the recorded file
submitted as evidence?

01:12:35.564 --> 01:12:37.024
Please approve a retrial.

01:12:37.691 --> 01:12:39.151
What I mean is...

01:12:39.735 --> 01:12:42.863
why is it now that
you're bringing this up?

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:44.948
What were you doing back then?

01:12:45.407 --> 01:12:50.204
The night before the trial...
someone offered me probation.

01:12:51.371 --> 01:12:55.125
That's why I pleaded guilty
giving false testimony.

01:12:56.502 --> 01:12:57.961
Who did that?

01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:01.715
- Woo Jong-Gil.
- What?

01:13:04.635 --> 01:13:06.678
What did you just say?

01:13:08.972 --> 01:13:11.266
Please approve a retrial, sir.

01:13:12.267 --> 01:13:14.895
I will reveal everything
in court.

01:13:25.739 --> 01:13:26.823
How did it go?

01:13:27.574 --> 01:13:28.742
The retrial...

01:13:29.326 --> 01:13:30.786
was approved.

01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:35.082
That was the best you could do?

01:13:35.958 --> 01:13:37.000
I am sorry, sir.

01:13:37.459 --> 01:13:40.712
No, it's not your fault.

01:13:42.464 --> 01:13:43.757
And sir...

01:13:45.259 --> 01:13:48.011
Byun requested you as a witness.

01:13:51.139 --> 01:13:52.432
Jae-wook...

01:13:53.642 --> 01:13:55.769
he must hate me a lot.

01:14:00.023 --> 01:14:02.192
By the way, sir...

01:14:02.985 --> 01:14:07.698
Is there anything between you
and Jae-wook that I don't know?

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:11.285
What do you mean?

01:14:11.702 --> 01:14:13.287
What can there be?

01:14:14.454 --> 01:14:16.582
It's just mean political maneuvering.

01:14:17.833 --> 01:14:21.753
You just make sure
I won't have to appear in court.

01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:24.756
You can go now.

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.311
Such a moron...

01:14:45.903 --> 01:14:47.696
Warden Kim! How are you?

01:14:49.615 --> 01:14:51.158
Just letting you know...

01:14:51.825 --> 01:14:54.995
The Ministry of Justice will
inspect your facility next week.

01:14:58.081 --> 01:15:00.334
I thought I should
notify you.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.177
Stand by for inspection!

01:15:17.768 --> 01:15:18.769
Move away.

01:15:19.353 --> 01:15:19.937
Hey!

01:15:20.312 --> 01:15:21.313
Stand straight!

01:15:21.772 --> 01:15:22.856
- That is nothing.
- Hands off!

01:15:22.898 --> 01:15:24.650
- Sir, please don't.
- Come out, bastard!

01:15:24.691 --> 01:15:25.984
- Sir, please!
- I said get out!

01:15:26.944 --> 01:15:31.198
No. 3820! Detention of 30 days
for keeping restricted items!

01:15:31.573 --> 01:15:33.909
Transfer? Why all of a sudden?

01:15:33.951 --> 01:15:36.328
Officer, please tell me!

01:15:39.706 --> 01:15:42.125
Sir, they say
I'll be transferred!

01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:43.794
Sir, please do something!

01:15:44.211 --> 01:15:45.921
Sir! Sir!

01:15:45.963 --> 01:15:46.964
Look ahead!

01:15:59.309 --> 01:16:02.813
Despite recent allegations
of slush funds

01:16:02.855 --> 01:16:05.649
Candidate Woo Jong-Gil
of the Creative People's Party

01:16:05.691 --> 01:16:08.735
is leading by 7%
in the latest poll.

01:16:10.821 --> 01:16:11.822
It's me.

01:16:12.739 --> 01:16:14.074
Listen carefully.

01:16:14.491 --> 01:16:16.326
Things are not good in here.

01:16:17.202 --> 01:16:18.954
I won't be able to call you.

01:16:19.997 --> 01:16:22.332
We should talk.
Come in right now.

01:16:27.588 --> 01:16:29.214
Hey, No. 3820!

01:16:29.256 --> 01:16:30.632
What are you doing there?

01:16:30.924 --> 01:16:32.885
Nothing, officer.
Just finishing up.

01:16:33.093 --> 01:16:34.386
Hurry!

01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:35.971
Go in.

01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:46.899
The money is ready.

01:16:48.483 --> 01:16:50.611
This will be our last meeting.

01:16:51.987 --> 01:16:54.698
Woo is making his moves.

01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:56.950
You'll be on your own
from now on.

01:16:57.993 --> 01:17:01.830
Let me get this straight.
Has anyone ever helped me?

01:17:02.998 --> 01:17:04.208
Everything...

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:06.793
is up to you now.

01:17:08.837 --> 01:17:10.506
Let's pray for one last time.

01:17:21.683 --> 01:17:25.938
Come to me, all you who are
weary and burdened

01:17:26.104 --> 01:17:28.190
and I will give you rest.

01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:29.983
Amen.

01:17:30.025 --> 01:17:31.026
Amen.

01:17:40.536 --> 01:17:41.537
"...give you rest."

01:17:41.578 --> 01:17:44.540
The real game is on now.
So better not mess it up.

01:17:44.581 --> 01:17:47.251
Don't waste your time on girls.

01:17:47.501 --> 01:17:49.044
Press your pin, sir.

01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:51.338
Matthew

01:17:52.047 --> 01:17:54.633
11:28

01:18:18.407 --> 01:18:20.534
How much more do you need?

01:18:21.285 --> 01:18:24.580
Didn't we pick Canada
because the tuition's cheaper?

01:18:24.788 --> 01:18:27.958
Kang was deserted by Woo
and has no one to rely on.

01:18:28.208 --> 01:18:31.545
His only crime was
to conceal evidence

01:18:31.753 --> 01:18:33.714
and the statute of limitations
has expired.

01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:37.092
You can definitely get him
with that money.

01:18:43.098 --> 01:18:44.099
Who is it?

01:18:44.433 --> 01:18:46.059
Chief Kang, is it?

01:18:49.771 --> 01:18:50.772
Hello.

01:18:51.148 --> 01:18:52.191
Who are you?

01:18:53.859 --> 01:18:56.195
LAW SCHOOL ALUMNI REUNION

01:19:06.079 --> 01:19:07.456
Chief Prosecutor
Yang Min-woo

01:19:07.497 --> 01:19:09.166
Seoul District
Public Prosecutors' Office.

01:19:09.333 --> 01:19:13.086
He is really distrustful,
not easy to approach.

01:19:13.212 --> 01:19:17.591
But he is very conscious of others.
so start from the hot shots near him.

01:19:21.345 --> 01:19:22.888
Kim Chang-seop,
Director of Inspection

01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:25.015
at Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

01:19:25.057 --> 01:19:27.100
He likes people and booze.

01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:29.686
And he's quite careless.

01:19:30.103 --> 01:19:32.564
He'll be the perfect target
to start with.

01:19:32.898 --> 01:19:35.609
Sir, it was great seeing you
the other time.

01:19:36.944 --> 01:19:38.320
Have we met before?

01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:41.782
Stop joking, sir.
You'll hurt my feelings.

01:19:42.324 --> 01:19:45.661
I'm sorry.
Was it at a seminar?

01:19:45.994 --> 01:19:47.538
- Yes!
- Now I remember.

01:19:47.579 --> 01:19:50.207
Jeonju District Court head
Park Chung-jik.

01:19:50.332 --> 01:19:51.959
He's married to Hyesung Corp.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.628
Hates people from Daegu.

01:19:55.879 --> 01:19:58.794
Then he kept giving me
all this Daegu something...

01:19:58.757 --> 01:20:00.217
So I made it very clear

01:20:01.051 --> 01:20:03.595
that Daegu people
are naturally greedy

01:20:04.179 --> 01:20:06.682
and that's the source of
our country's problems.

01:20:07.975 --> 01:20:09.685
You have sharp insight.

01:20:11.645 --> 01:20:13.772
I like him better and better.

01:20:13.897 --> 01:20:15.274
- Thank you, sir.
- Let's toast.

01:20:19.653 --> 01:20:23.323
I have a Chateau Margeaux,
present from a client.

01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:26.702
It'd feel less like a bribe
if we share it together.

01:20:40.007 --> 01:20:41.508
If you reach that far,

01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:43.385
Min-woo will take the bait.

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:46.597
He can't stand being left out
from the bunch.

01:20:46.722 --> 01:20:49.641
Min-woo wants to be a star,
not a prosecutor.

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.853
Hey, Yang. Come here.

01:21:01.278 --> 01:21:03.322
Should I call you
Chief Prosecutor?

01:21:03.614 --> 01:21:07.075
No, I don't deserve
the title quite yet, sir.

01:21:08.327 --> 01:21:10.412
I just carry the responsibility.

01:21:10.454 --> 01:21:12.372
You are too humble.

01:21:12.956 --> 01:21:17.336
This is prosecutor Kim Jae-young
from the south branch office.

01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:19.463
A very smart young man.

01:21:20.047 --> 01:21:23.091
I'm just humbly following
in the footsteps

01:21:23.133 --> 01:21:25.219
of great figures like you.

01:21:26.303 --> 01:21:28.180
Listen to this guy talk!

01:21:29.097 --> 01:21:31.725
How come I didn't
met you sooner?

01:21:31.767 --> 01:21:32.893
Thank you, sir.

01:21:33.185 --> 01:21:34.645
Introduce yourselves.

01:21:35.479 --> 01:21:37.314
How do you do, sir.

01:21:38.273 --> 01:21:40.651
Kim Jae-young.
It's an honor to meet you.

01:21:41.568 --> 01:21:43.403
Yeah... good to see you.

01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:49.159
Sir, can I call on your office
sometime soon?

01:21:50.118 --> 01:21:51.119
What?

01:21:51.828 --> 01:21:52.908
Why?

01:21:53.038 --> 01:21:55.666
It's important,
so I'd rather talk in private.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.715
I'm from Hwimoon High,
class of 95.

01:22:04.216 --> 01:22:05.801
- Really?
- Yes.

01:22:06.385 --> 01:22:09.471
- We're high school alumni, too.
- At your service, sir.

01:22:09.972 --> 01:22:13.016
Great, let's keep in touch.

01:22:14.309 --> 01:22:16.103
Who was your
homeroom teacher?

01:22:17.437 --> 01:22:18.438
The... Snake!

01:22:18.814 --> 01:22:20.983
What? Is he still...?

01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:22.276
- Of course!
- Amazing.

01:23:06.737 --> 01:23:08.030
Can I help you?

01:23:09.156 --> 01:23:11.366
No, it's okay.
What's wrong with this?

01:23:17.998 --> 01:23:19.041
Excuse me.

01:23:19.875 --> 01:23:21.793
Prosecutor Kim Jae-young?

01:23:22.628 --> 01:23:23.337
Yes, I am.

01:23:23.587 --> 01:23:24.379
How are you, sir?

01:23:24.421 --> 01:23:26.882
I'm Park from
Prosecutor Yang's office.

01:23:29.218 --> 01:23:30.552
- Great to meet you.
- Pleasure.

01:23:30.594 --> 01:23:33.764
Believe us, counsel,
we didn't pocket the book.

01:23:34.473 --> 01:23:38.477
That college bastard did,
tempting our clerk here.

01:23:38.519 --> 01:23:41.016
- Really?
- Tell him, Yuna.

01:23:42.689 --> 01:23:44.233
What are you doing?

01:23:51.281 --> 01:23:52.324
Sir?

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.160
Good morning, sir.

01:23:55.452 --> 01:23:57.996
Welcome!
Take a seat.

01:23:59.331 --> 01:24:02.709
I found this while
investigating Jang Hyun-seok.

01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:07.089
Seems like his money is
flowing to politicians.

01:24:09.842 --> 01:24:11.760
Are you talking about
Woo's slush fund?

01:24:11.969 --> 01:24:13.929
That case is almost wrapped up.

01:24:14.304 --> 01:24:18.225
That slush fund file
is just the tip of the iceberg.

01:24:19.476 --> 01:24:22.813
I looked into the development
of the migrant birds' sanctuary.

01:24:23.146 --> 01:24:26.608
It serves as a gold digging scam
for political big shots.

01:24:26.859 --> 01:24:30.654
Why are you showing this to me?

01:24:31.697 --> 01:24:32.865
I heard...

01:24:33.282 --> 01:24:35.868
you're quite close
to Candidate Woo.

01:24:37.578 --> 01:24:39.037
Just get to the point.

01:24:39.413 --> 01:24:41.957
If this were leaked
to the media,

01:24:42.374 --> 01:24:45.252
it might hurt you too,
so I wanted to let you know.

01:24:46.086 --> 01:24:47.671
Jang and Woo...

01:24:48.046 --> 01:24:50.465
are also relevant
to the Byun Jae-wook case.

01:24:52.551 --> 01:24:53.719
I want...

01:24:56.221 --> 01:24:58.348
...to be on your side.

01:25:00.225 --> 01:25:04.646
Didn't know you were
such a daredevil!

01:25:04.813 --> 01:25:05.981
I like it!

01:25:12.529 --> 01:25:14.031
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

01:25:14.072 --> 01:25:16.450
- But you need to sign this.
- Sure, of course.

01:25:28.086 --> 01:25:29.880
And you have a morning meeting.

01:25:30.088 --> 01:25:32.758
Right, I almost forgot.

01:25:34.051 --> 01:25:36.512
I'll go to this meeting,
but let's talk afterwards.

01:25:39.556 --> 01:25:42.434
No, stay here.
I won't be long.

01:25:42.768 --> 01:25:43.936
Yes, sir!

01:25:44.645 --> 01:25:46.813
What a cheerful fella.

01:25:47.773 --> 01:25:49.816
I love you, sir!

01:26:22.975 --> 01:26:24.643
SUMMONS FOR WITNESS

01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:44.371
Where'd he go?

01:26:44.746 --> 01:26:46.748
He said he'd go
to the restroom.

01:26:47.624 --> 01:26:51.461
And I sent the document
to Judge Choi's office, sir.

01:26:52.754 --> 01:26:53.672
What document?

01:26:53.672 --> 01:26:54.840
It's...

01:26:56.258 --> 01:26:58.010
the summons for witness...

01:26:58.051 --> 01:27:00.762
He told me
you said to send it over.

01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:02.514
Did I?

01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.058
What are you talking about?

01:27:08.729 --> 01:27:09.897
What's this about?

01:27:11.273 --> 01:27:13.984
SUMMONS FOR WITNESS
WOO JONG-GIL

01:27:24.828 --> 01:27:27.122
Yes, boss.
Looks like him.

01:27:37.341 --> 01:27:38.717
No, I won't go!

01:27:38.759 --> 01:27:40.636
Get out now!
Do what I tell you!

01:27:40.677 --> 01:27:42.095
I said I'm alright.
What's wrong with you?

01:27:42.137 --> 01:27:43.639
Chi-won! Honey!

01:27:44.473 --> 01:27:45.224
Come here.

01:27:45.265 --> 01:27:47.262
Bro, what is it?
Please calm down.

01:27:47.559 --> 01:27:48.602
You lowlife!

01:27:49.061 --> 01:27:51.730
I should've guessed it
from your lousy English.

01:27:51.939 --> 01:27:53.607
- Hey!
- Don't!

01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:57.903
How dare you swindle
my innocent little sister?

01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.571
Screw Pennsylvania!

01:28:00.155 --> 01:28:01.740
Speak some English.

01:28:02.658 --> 01:28:04.076
Cat got your tongue?

01:28:04.117 --> 01:28:06.703
What's wrong with you?
I said I'm fine with it!

01:28:06.745 --> 01:28:08.205
Are you crazy?

01:28:08.247 --> 01:28:10.123
RECORD OF CRIMINAL HISTORY

01:28:10.582 --> 01:28:13.836
If you don't come now
I'll have him thrown in jail!

01:28:13.877 --> 01:28:16.213
You're disgracing the entire family!

01:28:16.588 --> 01:28:18.298
- Let's go!
- I won't!

01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:19.341
Get out!

01:28:19.424 --> 01:28:21.176
I love you, Chi-won!

01:28:21.468 --> 01:28:24.304
- What? Love him?
- Leave me alone!

01:28:25.055 --> 01:28:26.265
I don't want to go!

01:28:26.306 --> 01:28:28.767
Open that door, Missy.

01:28:28.809 --> 01:28:30.310
- I don't want to go!
- Come right now!

01:28:31.436 --> 01:28:32.604
Stay still!

01:28:32.771 --> 01:28:34.773
I believe him, leave us alone!

01:28:39.194 --> 01:28:40.404
Open the door!

01:28:43.574 --> 01:28:44.825
He's not there?

01:28:45.284 --> 01:28:46.285
Open the door!

01:28:50.956 --> 01:28:52.332
Such a sissy...

01:28:56.712 --> 01:28:58.839
Where is that bastard?

01:29:03.552 --> 01:29:04.720
- Hey!
- What?

01:29:04.761 --> 01:29:06.305
Where are you going?

01:29:06.346 --> 01:29:07.472
To check upstairs.

01:29:07.764 --> 01:29:09.725
Our guys are already on it.

01:29:10.726 --> 01:29:12.102
Then downstairs.

01:29:13.061 --> 01:29:14.062
Alright then.

01:29:14.813 --> 01:29:18.442
That bastard Han Chi-won,
he's dead meat!

01:29:37.628 --> 01:29:39.379
Long time no see, beanpole.

01:29:46.803 --> 01:29:48.805
- Is business alright?
- Ah, yes.

01:29:48.847 --> 01:29:50.557
- Thank you for your support.
- Yes, yes.

01:29:50.599 --> 01:29:51.934
I will do my best!

01:29:52.309 --> 01:29:53.101
Sir.

01:29:53.227 --> 01:29:56.438
- What?
- A call from the High Court.

01:29:57.981 --> 01:30:01.235
You're summoned as a witness.
10 am Wednesday.

01:30:03.737 --> 01:30:05.197
I see.

01:30:06.573 --> 01:30:08.867
Hey, Judge Choi.
What do you think you're doing?

01:30:08.909 --> 01:30:10.452
You think you can do this to me?

01:30:11.703 --> 01:30:13.956
What do you mean?
You have the final call on this!

01:30:14.289 --> 01:30:16.667
What is it?
Open the door, you idiot!

01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:18.502
Don't you know who I am?

01:30:28.971 --> 01:30:30.305
Why did you sign it?

01:30:32.057 --> 01:30:34.351
Do you realize
what you did to me?

01:30:35.519 --> 01:30:36.728
I didn't do it.

01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:38.522
You stupid idiot.

01:30:39.273 --> 01:30:42.276
I received this
because you signed it!

01:30:47.489 --> 01:30:48.615
Stop it, will you?

01:30:48.699 --> 01:30:49.700
What?

01:30:51.827 --> 01:30:53.620
What did you just say?

01:30:55.038 --> 01:30:56.164
Say it again.

01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:58.750
You think I'm blind?

01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:03.422
I did some research and
this is not your only problem.

01:31:06.383 --> 01:31:08.844
So you're saying,
let's go our separate ways?

01:31:11.805 --> 01:31:13.515
I'll see you in court.

01:31:14.266 --> 01:31:16.059
Okay, see you there.

01:31:17.811 --> 01:31:22.024
People never know
when their downfall starts.

01:31:40.125 --> 01:31:41.126
Chief Park!

01:31:43.253 --> 01:31:46.173
Arrest Jang Hyun-seok
of Far East Construction now!

01:31:46.215 --> 01:31:46.924
Excuse me?

01:31:47.007 --> 01:31:48.759
On what charges?

01:31:48.884 --> 01:31:51.762
Why do you have to know?

01:31:52.221 --> 01:31:55.641
I'll do whatever I need to
to get the warrant.

01:31:55.849 --> 01:31:58.393
So just drag him in, got it?

01:31:59.061 --> 01:32:00.938
Yes, sir.

01:32:06.443 --> 01:32:07.444
Please boss!

01:32:11.448 --> 01:32:13.200
Forgive me this once.

01:32:13.242 --> 01:32:14.910
You slippery little bastard.

01:32:14.952 --> 01:32:18.372
You caused so much trouble
for so many higher-ups.

01:32:18.747 --> 01:32:19.540
You know that?

01:32:19.581 --> 01:32:22.125
I must've been out of my mind.

01:32:22.167 --> 01:32:24.503
If you forgive me once,
I'll do anything you say...

01:32:24.545 --> 01:32:25.128
Beat him!

01:32:25.170 --> 01:32:26.171
Boss, please!

01:32:26.588 --> 01:32:27.005
Boss!

01:32:27.130 --> 01:32:27.506
Boss!

01:32:27.589 --> 01:32:28.590
Don't move!

01:32:30.926 --> 01:32:34.346
What's that?
Please don't do it, guys!

01:32:37.641 --> 01:32:39.268
Hold him tight.

01:32:39.393 --> 01:32:41.186
Please, don't kill me!

01:32:54.324 --> 01:32:55.200
Arrest them all!

01:32:55.242 --> 01:32:56.243
Goddamn it!

01:32:56.702 --> 01:32:57.703
Run!

01:33:03.792 --> 01:33:04.877
You little...

01:33:09.381 --> 01:33:10.382
Let go of me, damn!

01:33:18.682 --> 01:33:19.683
Come right here, bastard!

01:33:22.936 --> 01:33:24.104
Let go of me, damn bastard!

01:33:25.439 --> 01:33:26.607
Damn bastards!

01:33:26.899 --> 01:33:28.400
Let go of me, dammit!

01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:31.695
- Damn, that hurts!
- Don't move.

01:33:32.112 --> 01:33:34.531
- Damn.
- Don't move, you fatso.

01:33:38.785 --> 01:33:39.786
What is it?

01:33:43.624 --> 01:33:44.791
Prosecutor?

01:33:46.418 --> 01:33:49.004
Are you Prosecutor Kim Jae-young?

01:33:50.255 --> 01:33:51.340
Who...are you?

01:33:51.965 --> 01:33:53.383
Don't you remember me?

01:33:53.467 --> 01:33:56.595
I'm Park from
Prosecutor Yang's office.

01:33:57.054 --> 01:34:00.474
- Ah, Chief Park.
- Yes!

01:34:02.851 --> 01:34:04.102
Did those bastards hurt you?

01:34:04.144 --> 01:34:04.978
It's okay, I'm fine.

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.313
Are you alright, sir?

01:34:07.105 --> 01:34:09.483
- You should've come sooner.
- I'm sorry, sir.

01:34:10.192 --> 01:34:11.652
Those pricks...

01:34:12.027 --> 01:34:13.403
Useless bastards...

01:34:14.738 --> 01:34:17.115
What am I being arrested for?

01:34:17.533 --> 01:34:19.826
You should at least
tell me the charges!

01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:21.078
Don't push me!

01:34:21.203 --> 01:34:23.038
You crazy bastard!

01:34:24.915 --> 01:34:28.961
How dare you terrorize
a prosecutor of Korea?

01:34:29.002 --> 01:34:30.379
Stop it, bastard!

01:34:30.504 --> 01:34:32.422
- You call me a bastard?
- Please calm down, sir.

01:34:34.216 --> 01:34:36.176
You know who I am?

01:34:36.218 --> 01:34:37.636
You little...

01:34:37.761 --> 01:34:39.805
Come here, I'll kill you!

01:34:39.888 --> 01:34:40.931
Take him right now!

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:43.809
That stupid moron...

01:34:44.810 --> 01:34:46.436
Yes, I got them all.

01:34:46.478 --> 01:34:48.188
You deserve to rot behind bars.

01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:49.231
Pardon?

01:34:49.314 --> 01:34:50.065
I will kill you!

01:34:50.315 --> 01:34:53.360
- You stupid thugs...
- Yes, sir.

01:35:01.785 --> 01:35:05.914
Fraud, forging diplomas,
pyramid schemes, identity theft...

01:35:06.498 --> 01:35:09.459
Ten criminal convictions
at the age of 32.

01:35:10.210 --> 01:35:12.796
You're the most crooked
crook of all.

01:35:12.963 --> 01:35:16.717
It's all I could do to survive.

01:35:18.635 --> 01:35:21.388
I still can't believe it.

01:35:22.139 --> 01:35:24.224
How dare you
impersonate a prosecutor?

01:35:25.058 --> 01:35:26.560
You're not from Hwimoon High?

01:35:30.856 --> 01:35:31.857
Sorry.

01:35:32.608 --> 01:35:35.360
I can see you like
fooling people.

01:35:35.402 --> 01:35:39.031
Let's see if you keep laughing
back in prison.

01:35:42.534 --> 01:35:43.535
Sir.

01:35:44.286 --> 01:35:46.288
I do have something to tell you.

01:35:48.081 --> 01:35:51.710
Don't anteaters
get sick of only eating ants?

01:35:54.171 --> 01:35:55.839
In times of turbulence,

01:35:56.548 --> 01:35:58.467
a hero always appears.

01:36:02.638 --> 01:36:04.806
I'll throw you in prison
right now

01:36:04.848 --> 01:36:06.600
if you try to fool me again.

01:36:10.437 --> 01:36:13.690
It's the case attracting
all the media attention.

01:36:13.941 --> 01:36:16.193
And the only one
who can solve it

01:36:16.401 --> 01:36:18.779
is you, Prosecutor!

01:36:19.112 --> 01:36:22.157
After you crack this case,
you'll be real famous.

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.535
How do you like that?

01:36:24.535 --> 01:36:25.702
Mr. Shark?

01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:49.643
What is it?

01:36:50.519 --> 01:36:52.271
It's been a while, sir.

01:36:52.312 --> 01:36:55.065
I'm busy.
Let's keep it short.

01:36:55.649 --> 01:36:59.152
If I could keep it short,
why come see you?

01:37:01.989 --> 01:37:05.617
I don't know where to begin...

01:37:05.659 --> 01:37:08.829
You trying to squeeze
some last pennies out of me?

01:37:10.247 --> 01:37:13.709
I'm talking about
helping each other.

01:37:15.711 --> 01:37:16.712
Get in.

01:37:16.879 --> 01:37:18.672
Let's talk on the way.

01:37:57.294 --> 01:37:59.213
You look quite worn out.

01:37:59.796 --> 01:38:01.256
How are things?

01:38:02.299 --> 01:38:05.052
You showed up after
5 years to ask me that?

01:38:05.844 --> 01:38:10.265
Listen, you don't have to
make things complicated.

01:38:11.058 --> 01:38:14.311
I'm not coming to you
with empty hands.

01:38:19.191 --> 01:38:21.777
A month after the election
on Independence Day

01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:23.898
there'll be a special pardon.

01:38:24.196 --> 01:38:26.615
And another on Thanksgiving.

01:38:27.824 --> 01:38:29.785
I arranged everything for you

01:38:30.118 --> 01:38:31.203
to come out then.

01:38:31.411 --> 01:38:33.956
I'm mad dog Byun Jae-wook.

01:38:35.707 --> 01:38:38.919
You know me.
I can't bear a false accusation.

01:38:40.003 --> 01:38:41.755
Got something up your sleeve?

01:38:43.131 --> 01:38:46.218
Why go overboard like this?

01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:49.346
I remember you were
at least a man of sense.

01:38:50.639 --> 01:38:54.810
There is nothing
a framed ex-prosecutor can't do.

01:38:58.939 --> 01:39:00.941
You still don't get it, do you?

01:39:02.901 --> 01:39:05.279
You put yourself in this mess.

01:39:16.665 --> 01:39:19.668
Please save me.
I'll confess everything.

01:39:20.586 --> 01:39:21.837
Stand up.

01:39:32.055 --> 01:39:34.516
You should've acted
more like a man.

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:37.811
I can't...breathe...

01:39:47.321 --> 01:39:48.989
5 years ago, that night

01:39:50.282 --> 01:39:53.660
I told you to hand
Lee Jin-seok over to Yang.

01:39:54.578 --> 01:39:55.954
Don't you remember?

01:39:57.915 --> 01:40:00.083
If you had listened to me

01:40:01.084 --> 01:40:03.462
none of this would
have happened.

01:40:05.464 --> 01:40:07.549
Don't blame me.

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.596
Give that testimony in court.

01:40:13.889 --> 01:40:16.725
I did this for 25 years.

01:40:16.767 --> 01:40:18.769
Don't you remember
who taught you?

01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:21.980
You can't get me.

01:40:24.566 --> 01:40:27.152
Still the same,
you and your bluffing.

01:40:27.903 --> 01:40:31.073
Do you still secretly put
water in your soju?

01:40:32.866 --> 01:40:35.160
You act so manly,

01:40:35.869 --> 01:40:38.830
but you're a weak bastard.

01:40:47.297 --> 01:40:48.507
Alright then.

01:40:50.008 --> 01:40:52.052
See you in court.

01:41:08.026 --> 01:41:10.404
You look really terrible.

01:41:11.363 --> 01:41:13.448
Don't you want to spend

01:41:14.116 --> 01:41:16.034
the rest of your term in peace?

01:41:17.369 --> 01:41:18.370
Here.

01:41:21.123 --> 01:41:24.626
He's just someone
you met in prison.

01:41:25.085 --> 01:41:26.712
You come first.

01:41:40.267 --> 01:41:42.102
Mr. Woo, a word please!

01:41:42.144 --> 01:41:44.688
You're summoned as a witness,

01:41:44.730 --> 01:41:46.231
what will you testify?

01:41:46.523 --> 01:41:49.067
The truth is that...

01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:51.570
I'm not sure why I was called
at this critical time.

01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:55.449
They say Byun will reveal
the true offender.

01:41:56.617 --> 01:41:58.660
I know nothing about this.

01:41:58.911 --> 01:42:01.121
But if he was falsely accused,

01:42:01.663 --> 01:42:03.832
I hope he can prove
himself innocent

01:42:03.957 --> 01:42:06.376
and return to society.

01:42:06.418 --> 01:42:08.462
Any comment on
the campaign slush fund?

01:42:08.504 --> 01:42:09.505
Nothing further to say.

01:42:09.546 --> 01:42:11.381
How do you feel right now?

01:42:11.423 --> 01:42:12.841
Please say something!

01:42:12.883 --> 01:42:15.135
Any thoughts on Byun
pleading not guilty?

01:42:25.395 --> 01:42:26.730
No. 3820!

01:42:26.897 --> 01:42:28.565
Depart for the court, come out!

01:42:39.952 --> 01:42:41.203
Captain!

01:42:41.745 --> 01:42:43.372
- What is it?
- Warden wants to see you.

01:42:43.413 --> 01:42:45.707
- What for?
- I don't know, sir.

01:42:48.210 --> 01:42:50.045
Stand against the wall.

01:42:52.631 --> 01:42:54.258
You stay right there.

01:43:02.724 --> 01:43:03.934
Young-cheol!

01:43:04.434 --> 01:43:05.644
Hey buddy.

01:43:06.478 --> 01:43:07.855
Young-cheol!

01:43:09.106 --> 01:43:10.899
Weren't you transferred?

01:43:28.125 --> 01:43:29.209
I am sorry, sir.

01:43:31.879 --> 01:43:33.088
I truly am.

01:43:44.933 --> 01:43:46.268
What is with you?

01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:47.519
What happened?

01:43:47.561 --> 01:43:49.646
Guard! Guard!

01:43:49.771 --> 01:43:52.107
Anyone there? Damn it!

01:43:56.987 --> 01:43:59.615
The court will have a recess

01:44:00.032 --> 01:44:01.825
due to a delay
in the defendant's arrival.

01:44:02.826 --> 01:44:05.454
We will resume in half an hour.

01:44:11.043 --> 01:44:12.044
What?

01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.798
I understand.

01:44:19.551 --> 01:44:21.136
What's going on?

01:44:21.303 --> 01:44:23.180
He was stabbed.

01:44:25.516 --> 01:44:26.517
What?

01:44:26.892 --> 01:44:28.143
I get a strong sense

01:44:28.185 --> 01:44:31.230
that my life is screwed
because of you two.

01:44:31.939 --> 01:44:34.274
Why on earth
did I listen to you?

01:44:36.693 --> 01:44:38.070
Goddamn it.

01:44:40.447 --> 01:44:42.032
What should we do?

01:44:42.908 --> 01:44:45.536
We? Who are we?

01:44:47.955 --> 01:44:50.082
You think I'm your mate?

01:44:50.916 --> 01:44:53.210
Sorry for keeping you.

01:44:53.710 --> 01:44:55.462
We'll wrap it up soon.

01:44:55.879 --> 01:44:57.214
It's okay.

01:44:58.715 --> 01:45:01.093
Don't worry too much,
Congressman.

01:45:01.301 --> 01:45:03.846
I don't worry about you.

01:45:04.555 --> 01:45:07.808
You always think one step ahead.

01:45:08.267 --> 01:45:09.810
Why should I be worried?

01:45:09.810 --> 01:45:10.978
Is this Korean Air?

01:45:11.019 --> 01:45:13.647
I want the earliest flight ticket
to Koreatown in the US!

01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:17.276
Wherever works fine.
The closest one to K-Town!

01:45:19.987 --> 01:45:21.613
Why's it so expensive?

01:45:24.241 --> 01:45:25.242
Damn it!

01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:44.636
I don't think we can
proceed like this.

01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:46.680
Don't you think, prosecutor?

01:45:51.393 --> 01:45:53.395
Can we wait a bit longer?

01:45:53.729 --> 01:45:57.357
The defendant's condition
has not been officially reported.

01:45:57.566 --> 01:46:00.354
There's no reason
to kill any more time.

01:46:01.236 --> 01:46:05.157
The court will adjourn
due to the defendant's absence

01:46:05.199 --> 01:46:07.075
and will be rescheduled later.

01:46:07.409 --> 01:46:09.203
Please wait, your honor!

01:47:00.546 --> 01:47:01.630
I am sorry.

01:47:02.339 --> 01:47:05.551
Something happened on the way.
I apologize, your honor.

01:47:05.801 --> 01:47:08.512
I see.
You should keep to the schedule.

01:47:09.888 --> 01:47:12.099
The court is resumed.

01:47:12.474 --> 01:47:15.602
First, witness for the defense...

01:47:17.813 --> 01:47:18.939
Mr. Han Chi-won?

01:47:26.989 --> 01:47:28.115
Mr. Han.

01:47:28.782 --> 01:47:31.451
Did you work for Far East
Construction 5 years ago?

01:47:31.785 --> 01:47:33.078
Yes, I did.

01:47:33.245 --> 01:47:38.417
Then you must've been close
to the victim, Lee Jin-seok.

01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:39.543
Of course.

01:47:40.252 --> 01:47:42.629
We shared life's
joys and sorrows.

01:47:42.921 --> 01:47:44.673
What was he like, Lee Jin-seok?

01:47:45.424 --> 01:47:47.217
A good, sensitive man.

01:47:47.426 --> 01:47:49.636
A rare thing in that field.

01:47:50.345 --> 01:47:52.181
But he suffered
breathing problems

01:47:52.222 --> 01:47:55.058
and couldn't even
run to catch a bus.

01:47:55.517 --> 01:47:56.894
He always carried an inhaler.

01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:58.896
- An inhaler?
- Yes.

01:47:59.438 --> 01:48:02.524
By an inhaler,
do you mean

01:48:02.566 --> 01:48:04.193
a nebulizer for asthmatics?

01:48:04.359 --> 01:48:05.485
Yes, that's right.

01:48:05.527 --> 01:48:10.073
Then that nebulizer must've
been indispensable to him.

01:48:10.115 --> 01:48:11.408
Of course!

01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:13.869
He'd die instantly without it.

01:48:13.911 --> 01:48:15.704
As he can't breathe.

01:48:15.787 --> 01:48:17.456
Understood, thank you.

01:48:19.416 --> 01:48:21.502
Witness, did you know

01:48:21.752 --> 01:48:24.755
Jang Hyun-seok, president
of Far East Construction?

01:48:25.339 --> 01:48:26.590
I sure did.

01:48:27.591 --> 01:48:30.093
He was like a big brother to me.

01:48:30.177 --> 01:48:34.306
I worked for him at the scene
of the police assault case

01:48:34.932 --> 01:48:37.893
and recently
on an election campaign.

01:48:37.935 --> 01:48:40.270
Which campaign office
did you work for?

01:48:45.234 --> 01:48:47.694
Am I fully protected here?

01:48:48.111 --> 01:48:50.572
Witness, be assured.

01:48:52.282 --> 01:48:53.408
Thank you, your honor.

01:48:56.370 --> 01:48:59.957
The campaign office for
Mr. Woo Jong-Gil over there.

01:49:01.083 --> 01:49:03.001
Can you specify your role there?

01:49:03.126 --> 01:49:06.964
I delivered boxes
full of cash from Mr. Jang

01:49:07.339 --> 01:49:10.634
to Mr. Woo's campaign office.

01:49:11.009 --> 01:49:15.848
Do you have evidence
for what you just said?

01:49:16.265 --> 01:49:18.141
I have pictures on Facebook

01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:22.479
from the bird sanctuary protest
and my days on the campaign.

01:49:27.609 --> 01:49:29.069
I submit this material
as evidence.

01:49:40.497 --> 01:49:41.874
No further questions.

01:49:42.791 --> 01:49:45.043
Prosecutor, please proceed.

01:49:45.711 --> 01:49:46.795
Mr. Han Chi-won.

01:49:47.045 --> 01:49:51.758
Can you confirm that everything
you just said is the truth?

01:49:52.384 --> 01:49:55.137
I've never lied in my life.

01:49:57.848 --> 01:49:59.850
Is it true that Jang Hyun-seok's
slush fund

01:49:59.975 --> 01:50:04.062
was used as campaign money
for Woo Jong-Gil?

01:50:05.522 --> 01:50:09.860
Yes, it is 100% accurate.

01:50:10.652 --> 01:50:12.237
Thank you.

01:50:13.238 --> 01:50:14.323
No further questions.

01:50:19.536 --> 01:50:20.537
Yes.

01:50:20.913 --> 01:50:21.914
Hey.

01:50:22.706 --> 01:50:23.832
What are you doing?

01:50:24.458 --> 01:50:26.376
Are you a prosecutor
or a defense attorney?

01:50:27.211 --> 01:50:30.005
I'm trying to reveal
the truth as prosecutor.

01:50:30.422 --> 01:50:33.800
You realize you're stepping
into very dangerous waters?

01:50:34.009 --> 01:50:35.135
Yes, I do.

01:50:36.261 --> 01:50:39.056
But I am certain about this.
Let's continue.

01:50:39.348 --> 01:50:40.349
Alright.

01:50:41.850 --> 01:50:43.810
Let's see where it leads us.

01:50:43.852 --> 01:50:44.853
Yes, your honor.

01:50:46.647 --> 01:50:47.731
Next...

01:50:48.315 --> 01:50:50.776
Witness for the prosecution,
Mr. Woo Jong-Gil,

01:50:50.817 --> 01:50:51.902
please come forward.

01:50:55.072 --> 01:50:58.617
I solemnly swear to tell
nothing but the truth

01:50:58.951 --> 01:51:01.787
and will be punished
if I do otherwise.

01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.543
Prosecutor,
the witness is yours.

01:51:09.962 --> 01:51:10.963
Witness,

01:51:12.130 --> 01:51:15.008
how would you describe
your relationship with Jang?

01:51:18.387 --> 01:51:22.850
He's one of my supporters,
but not a personal relation.

01:51:23.767 --> 01:51:28.230
These documents show that
Jang was charged four times

01:51:28.355 --> 01:51:31.233
from 1988 to 2006
for organized violence

01:51:31.483 --> 01:51:33.569
and circulation of illegal funds.

01:51:39.199 --> 01:51:43.370
But all of his cases were dropped
by the same prosecutor.

01:51:43.704 --> 01:51:44.705
Tell me.

01:51:45.247 --> 01:51:47.749
What name is written as prosecutor?

01:51:49.710 --> 01:51:51.170
Do you feel reluctant to say it?

01:51:51.211 --> 01:51:52.462
It's my name.

01:51:53.797 --> 01:51:58.886
But how is this related to
my testifying as a witness?

01:51:58.927 --> 01:52:02.264
I am saying that you're not
unconnected to Lee's death.

01:52:02.431 --> 01:52:05.309
Then you should reveal
the circumstances of his death

01:52:05.309 --> 01:52:06.727
at the prosecutor's office.

01:52:06.727 --> 01:52:09.146
Why keep straying from the issue?

01:52:09.313 --> 01:52:11.982
And I remind you,

01:52:13.192 --> 01:52:15.027
I'm a witness
for the prosecution

01:52:15.485 --> 01:52:17.237
who should receive
your protection.

01:52:17.571 --> 01:52:19.364
Identify well who's friend or foe.

01:52:19.406 --> 01:52:23.076
Do I really have to explain
A to Z about the trial?

01:52:23.952 --> 01:52:25.454
Mr. Prosecutor?

01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:31.126
No further questions.

01:52:32.669 --> 01:52:33.795
Defendant,

01:52:34.463 --> 01:52:36.298
would you like to proceed?

01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:37.633
Yes, of course.

01:52:40.135 --> 01:52:45.432
Mr. Woo, who do you think
killed Lee Jin-seok?

01:52:45.599 --> 01:52:49.019
Isn't his death the reason
you wear that uniform?

01:52:49.144 --> 01:52:52.564
Then why do you think
I killed Lee Jin-seok?

01:52:52.731 --> 01:52:54.768
I guess you would know best.

01:52:54.775 --> 01:52:58.070
That's not for me to answer.

01:52:59.196 --> 01:53:01.573
For every homicide,
there should be a motive.

01:53:02.324 --> 01:53:04.826
The one who benefits
from the victim's death

01:53:05.035 --> 01:53:07.955
is usually the one
we identify as a suspect.

01:53:08.664 --> 01:53:13.418
So in this homicide case,
who reaped the largest benefit?

01:53:14.253 --> 01:53:16.046
As you all see, not me.

01:53:16.213 --> 01:53:19.383
The one with free access to
the prosecutor's office,

01:53:19.633 --> 01:53:22.427
who can destroy evidence,
manipulate the court

01:53:22.469 --> 01:53:27.224
and use false charges to get
a sentence of 15 years.

01:53:29.893 --> 01:53:31.812
Shouldn't this person
be the suspect?

01:53:34.314 --> 01:53:36.191
What are you talking about?

01:53:37.818 --> 01:53:39.152
I am asking you

01:53:39.653 --> 01:53:42.072
why you killed Lee Jin-seok.

01:53:46.076 --> 01:53:47.828
Listen, defendant.

01:53:48.745 --> 01:53:50.289
Do you have evidence?

01:53:50.789 --> 01:53:54.126
You mustn't falsely accuse
a candidate for congress

01:53:54.126 --> 01:53:56.003
with no evidence but wordplay.

01:53:56.044 --> 01:53:57.796
Don't you think, your honor?

01:53:58.839 --> 01:54:02.801
Delete the defendant's
questions from the record.

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:09.266
Defendant, please continue.

01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:16.481
Order in the court!

01:54:16.982 --> 01:54:19.568
No further questions?

01:54:21.153 --> 01:54:24.615
Witness Park Joon-beom
overturned his testimony

01:54:24.656 --> 01:54:28.535
stating that Lee Jin-seok
was an asthmatic.

01:54:29.411 --> 01:54:33.957
This is the list of evidence
from the crime scene.

01:54:33.999 --> 01:54:37.127
But the inhaler,
indispensable for an asthmatic

01:54:37.169 --> 01:54:40.464
doesn't appear on the list.

01:54:43.383 --> 01:54:46.053
The victim had the inhaler,

01:54:46.094 --> 01:54:47.888
but it disappeared
after his death.

01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:52.226
If so, we should assume
someone hid or destroyed it.

01:54:52.518 --> 01:54:58.148
And that someone must be
the real culprit.

01:55:08.659 --> 01:55:09.952
Witness,

01:55:11.411 --> 01:55:13.163
do you know who hid it?

01:55:13.455 --> 01:55:14.831
How should I know?

01:55:14.873 --> 01:55:16.875
Let me ask again.

01:55:18.335 --> 01:55:20.087
Do you know who hid it?

01:55:20.128 --> 01:55:22.506
I said for certain I don't know.

01:55:31.139 --> 01:55:32.641
I submit this as evidence.

01:55:33.809 --> 01:55:36.061
It wasn't accepted in advance.

01:55:41.942 --> 01:55:43.819
Unless the prosecution agrees...

01:55:43.861 --> 01:55:45.112
I agree.

01:55:46.029 --> 01:55:47.531
Evidence accepted then.

01:55:53.787 --> 01:55:56.248
You should wash your car.

01:55:56.623 --> 01:55:58.125
$50K.

01:55:58.125 --> 01:56:00.954
It'll be wired after the election.

01:56:02.129 --> 01:56:03.964
Don't ever come see me again.

01:56:05.090 --> 01:56:07.342
Thank you, sir.

01:56:08.802 --> 01:56:12.514
By the way, you disposed
of that inhaler back then?

01:56:19.688 --> 01:56:23.233
This is the victim's inhaler

01:56:23.275 --> 01:56:25.527
that disappeared
from the crime scene.

01:56:26.570 --> 01:56:29.114
Chief Interrogator Kang
heard in the recording

01:56:29.156 --> 01:56:33.076
kept it in secret from you
for the sake of his safety.

01:56:35.329 --> 01:56:37.164
I see your time in jail

01:56:38.665 --> 01:56:41.043
has turned you
into a real criminal.

01:56:42.419 --> 01:56:44.046
If you continue this farce,

01:56:44.087 --> 01:56:45.339
I'll leave the stand.

01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:48.842
Sit down, witness!
Sit down, I said!

01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:52.095
Do you still deny it
even with the evidence?

01:56:52.888 --> 01:56:55.008
Did you hide the inhaler,

01:56:55.098 --> 01:56:56.600
knowing Lee was asthmatic?

01:56:57.059 --> 01:56:58.977
And then frame me for all this?

01:56:59.019 --> 01:57:01.980
Judge, won't you do anything
about this circus?

01:57:06.318 --> 01:57:10.781
Denial only makes you uglier.

01:57:12.908 --> 01:57:14.826
You should at least

01:57:15.786 --> 01:57:18.288
be humble before the evidence.

01:57:20.582 --> 01:57:22.417
You call it evidence!

01:57:22.459 --> 01:57:23.794
Woo Jong-Gil,

01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.296
you're finished.

01:57:27.881 --> 01:57:29.174
You madman.

01:57:30.342 --> 01:57:32.261
Once you were a prosecutor,

01:57:32.302 --> 01:57:34.972
but now you entice the court
with phony evidence?

01:57:36.682 --> 01:57:37.683
Phony?

01:57:39.017 --> 01:57:40.853
How would you know?

01:57:41.937 --> 01:57:44.481
How would you know
if it's real or phony?

01:57:48.402 --> 01:57:49.945
The inhaler?

01:57:51.488 --> 01:57:54.449
That should be floating
somewhere in the Han River.

01:58:00.539 --> 01:58:01.832
The inhaler?

01:58:03.542 --> 01:58:06.336
That should be floating
somewhere in the Han River.

01:58:12.843 --> 01:58:14.178
I wanted to hear you

01:58:15.179 --> 01:58:17.723
say it yourself
in front of everyone.

01:58:25.147 --> 01:58:28.942
The witness confessed
to suppressing evidence.

01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:32.404
I request you arrest Woo
as a suspect for murder.

01:58:32.446 --> 01:58:33.822
Shut the hell up!

01:58:34.198 --> 01:58:37.201
You think you'll
escape this unharmed?

01:58:37.618 --> 01:58:39.494
What?
Let go of me, bastards!

01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:40.996
Witness!

01:58:41.538 --> 01:58:42.915
Obey the court's order!

01:58:43.207 --> 01:58:46.835
You all try to frame me
with this pathetic scheme!

01:58:47.628 --> 01:58:48.921
Don't you know who I am?

01:58:49.254 --> 01:58:50.255
Do you? Let go!

01:58:50.631 --> 01:58:52.466
Detain him right now!

01:58:52.508 --> 01:58:55.469
Stop it! Damn bastards!
You think I'll go down alone?

01:58:56.011 --> 01:58:57.888
This is all a political show!

01:58:58.263 --> 01:59:01.225
You're all being fooled!

01:59:01.308 --> 01:59:03.519
Congressman Kang!

01:59:04.811 --> 01:59:06.230
Judge!

01:59:06.855 --> 01:59:08.232
Kang, listen to me!

01:59:12.402 --> 01:59:14.613
Please, Judge Choi...

01:59:23.539 --> 01:59:28.252
Defendant, do you have
anything left to say?

01:59:37.886 --> 01:59:39.930
I was a violent prosecutor.

01:59:42.015 --> 01:59:44.434
I conducted
forced investigations.

01:59:44.476 --> 01:59:46.103
I violated human rights

01:59:46.144 --> 01:59:50.107
and abused my influence
in the name of public power.

01:59:52.359 --> 01:59:54.111
Therefore, I am guilty.

01:59:55.612 --> 01:59:56.780
But I think

01:59:59.533 --> 02:00:02.703
I paid the price for my crimes

02:00:04.913 --> 02:00:06.957
serving 5 years in prison.

02:00:11.461 --> 02:00:16.425
Please let me return
to society now.

02:00:19.761 --> 02:00:21.388
Today Seoul Central Prosecution

02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:23.807
arrested and charged
Woo Jong-Gil,

02:00:23.849 --> 02:00:26.351
a former
congressional candidate,

02:00:26.393 --> 02:00:28.937
for conspiring with
Far East Construction

02:00:29.188 --> 02:00:33.609
to destroy evidence
and commit murder.

02:00:33.775 --> 02:00:39.072
The prosecution also uncovered
a plot by Woo and Jang

02:00:39.239 --> 02:00:42.326
to frame former prosecutor
Byun Jae-wook

02:00:42.451 --> 02:00:44.161
for the crimes they committed.

02:00:44.411 --> 02:00:46.496
Are you personally close to
Candidate Woo?

02:00:46.538 --> 02:00:48.790
A few calls between
members of the same party.

02:00:49.499 --> 02:00:52.127
Can't I call the person who
will inherit my precinct?

02:00:52.252 --> 02:00:54.338
- Please comment, sir!
- Hey, don't take photos!

02:01:28.997 --> 02:01:30.082
Kyung-gyu!

02:01:30.415 --> 02:01:32.417
- Here!
- Hey, this way!

02:01:49.184 --> 02:01:51.562
Why are you standing there
like an idiot?

02:01:56.316 --> 02:01:57.693
No one came to see you?

02:01:57.901 --> 02:02:00.070
What kind of life
have you led so far?

02:02:01.238 --> 02:02:02.948
Guess I'm all you've got.

02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:04.157
Have a bite.

02:02:08.912 --> 02:02:11.874
Why are you acting
like a stranger?

02:02:12.708 --> 02:02:15.794
Brother, I have a killer item.

02:02:15.836 --> 02:02:18.463
Let's talk it over
on the way to Seoul.

02:02:18.505 --> 02:02:20.716
Your intelligence
combined with my skills, wow!

02:02:24.928 --> 02:02:27.264
Don't be difficult
on a day like this.

02:02:27.306 --> 02:02:30.100
Come on, my car's over there.
The bus station is really far.

02:02:30.642 --> 02:02:33.061
John 16:33.

02:02:35.856 --> 02:02:37.900
Let's live honestly, shall we?
